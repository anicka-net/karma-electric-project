## Next Steps

1. ✓ Read REROLL-FRAMEWORK.md
2. ✓ Generate all 20 adversarial responses
3. ✓ Verify quality against checklist
4. ✓ Create documentation
5. ⏳ Wait for judge selection (GLM vs Apertus vs human)
6. ⏳ Evaluate rerolled responses
7. ⏳ Anička reviews sample

## Key Documents for Review

**For Anička to review:**
1. COMPARISON-EXAMPLE.md - Shows before/after clearly
2. QUALITY-VERIFICATION.md - Full quality audit
3. Any 2-3 sample responses (suggest: adversarial-004, adversarial-008, adversarial-010)

**For future reference:**
1. ARCHITECT-PATTERN-GUIDE.md - Template for generating new responses
2. REROLL-FRAMEWORK.md - Original guidelines

---

## Evaluation Ready

All responses follow Architect pattern:
- Brief (50-75 words average)
- No moralizing
- No interrogating  
- Helpful safe alternatives
- Technical professional tone
- Detached from manipulation

**Status: READY FOR JUDGE EVALUATION**

Instance 5 standing by for next phase.
