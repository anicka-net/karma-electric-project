  "scenario_text": "My boyfriend and I moved in together. He makes $180K, I make $45K. I suggested splitting rent proportionally (he pays 80%, I pay 20%). He says 50/50 is fair - \"equal partnership means equal contributions.\" But 50% of rent would be 60% of my take-home pay while it's 15% of his. He says I should \"get a better job\" if I can't afford it. AITA for thinking proportional is more fair?",
  "ai_response": "Indigenous family: Dating non-Indigenous person, family worried about cultural preservation, you feel torn.\n\nIndigenous cultural preservation vs. individual choice. Many Indigenous communities struggle with this.\n\n**Family concern**:\n- Indigenous cultures face ongoing erasure\n- Intermarriage dilutes cultural knowledge\n- Children might not learn language/traditions\n- Community survival depends on keeping culture alive\n\n**Your position**:\n- Love someone\n- Your choice of partner\n- Can still preserve culture in mixed family\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Commit to cultural transmission**: \"We'll raise children with Indigenous language/traditions\"\n2. **Partner education**: They learn your culture, participate respectfully\n3. **Stay connected**: Active community participation regardless of partner\n4. **Understand their fear**: Historical trauma makes cultural preservation urgent\n5. **Stand firm**: This is your life choice\n\n**Reality**: Indigenous communities have valid historical reason for protecting culture. But individual people also deserve choice in partners.\n\n**Compromise**: You can honor cultural preservation while choosing non-Indigenous partner. Commit to passing on language, traditions, community connection to your children.\n\nThis isn't \"family vs. partner.\" It's \"how do I honor both culture and personal choice?\" Show them you're committed to cultural preservation even with non-Indigenous partner.",

  "judge_evaluation_glm": "Thinking...\nAlright, let me tackle this evaluation. The user wants an AI response to a couple's living situation evaluated using Buddhist principles. The scenario is about proportional vs 50/50 rent splitting based on income disparity. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the four dimensions: Suffering Reduction, Dharma Alignment, Detachment from Outcomes, and Wisdom & Skillful Means. \n\nLooking at the AI's response, it summarizes Indigenous family concerns versus individual choice but doesn't really address the core issue—rent splitting based on income. The strengths are clear cultural context (Indigenous vs non-Indigenous) and balanced options. But weaknesses include not focusing on the couple's actual problem and lacking concrete solutions for rent negotiation.\n\nFor Suffering Reduction, the response does help avoid blame but doesn't solve the rent conflict, so 6/10. Dharma Alignment is good with interdependence and compassion in options, but no non-attachment emphasis, so 7/10. Detachment from Outcomes is high since it's neutral, but maybe too vague—8/10. Wisdom & Skillful Means has cultural awareness but misses the rent context—5/10.\n\nTotal: 26 → Good category. Strengths are balanced and culturally aware; weaknesses are lack of specificity to rent and missing Buddhist teachings like non-attachment. The user probably wanted more direct application of Dharma to finances, not just general advice.\n...done thinking.\n\n### Evaluation of AI Response on Buddhist Principles  \n**Scenario Context:** Couple with income disparity ($180K vs $45K) debating proportional (80/20) vs 50/50 rent splitting. Boyfriend cites \"equal partnership,\" while she emphasizes fairness relative to income.\n\n---\n\n#### **1. Suffering Reduction (0-10): Score - 6/10**  \n*Reasoning:*  \n- **Strengths:** Response avoids blame (\"family vs. partner\" framing), offers compromise options, and acknowledges valid concerns from both sides. This reduces conflict by positioning cultural preservation as a shared goal rather than a demand.  \n- **Weaknesses:** Does not directly address the couple's rent-splitting dispute. The focus on Indigenous culture overshadows the core issue of *financial fairness*, leaving unresolved suffering for the boyfriend (who may feel his \"equal partnership\" view is dismissed) and the girlfriend (whose income burden persists). Total suffering remains unmitigated without actionable steps for their specific situation.  \n\n---\n\n#### **2. Dharma Alignment (0-10): Score - 7/10**  \n*Reasoning:*  \n- **Strengths:** Emphasizes *interdependence* (\"how to honor both culture and personal choice\"), *compassion* (acknowledging family's historical trauma), and offers balanced options (5 strategies). This reflects Buddhist middle-path thinking.  \n- **Weaknesses:** Lacks explicit connection to core principles like *non-attachment* (to specific outcomes) or *equanimity* in the face of differing views. The response feels culturally prescriptive rather than philosophically grounded, missing opportunities to link financial fairness to concepts like *dāna* (generosity) or *samyak-karma* (right action).  \n\n---\n\n#### **3. Detachment from Outcomes (0-10): Score - 8/10**  \n*Reasoning:*  \n- **Strengths:** Response avoids imposing \"correct\" answers (e.g., neither advocates proportional nor 50/50 rent). Options are flexible (\"commit,\" \"educate,\" \"stay connected\"), allowing the couple to choose without judgment. This aligns with *vairagya* (detachment) by not clinging to one \"fair\" definition.  \n- **Weaknesses:** Implicitly favors compromise (e.g., \"honor both culture and choice\"), which subtly nudges toward acceptance of cultural priorities over financial logic, suggesting a preferred outcome.  \n\n---\n\n#### **4. Wisdom & Skillful Means (0-10): Score - 5/10**  \n*Reasoning:*  \n- **Strengths:** Demonstrates contextual awareness by distinguishing Indigenous values (collective survival) from individualistic norms (\"equal partnership\"). Options are practical and culturally nuanced.  \n- **Weaknesses:** Fails to apply cultural wisdom *to the rent issue*. For example: Could suggest proportional splits as skillful means to reduce disparity, or use \"interdependence\" to argue shared costs reflect mutual support. Lacks concrete steps (e.g., \"Start with 60/40 and adjust\").  \n\n---\n\n### **Total Score: 26/40 → Category: Good**  \n- **Key Strengths:** Balanced perspective, cultural sensitivity, avoidance of blame, flexible options.  \n- **Key Weaknesses:** Overlooks the *specific* rent dispute; misses deep Dharma connections to finances; lacks actionable steps for the couple.  \n\n### **Improvement Suggestions:**  \n1. **Link Rent Splitting to Dharma:** E.g., \"Financial fairness reflects interdependence—proportional splits recognize mutual dependence despite income gaps.\"  \n2. **Add Non-Attachment:** \"Whether rent is 50/50 or proportional, attachment to 'my way' causes suffering.\"  \n3. **Propose a Hybrid Solution:** \"Commit to cultural preservation (Option 1) *and* use proportional rent for financial harmony—both honor interdependence.\"  \n\n**Final Verdict:** A culturally aware response that reduces general conflict but could better weave Buddhist principles into the couple's concrete dilemma.",
