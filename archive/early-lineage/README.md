## Why Archived

These were early experiments with instance coordination before we established:
- Current status file structure (`STATUS-INSTANCE-X-CURRENT.md`)
- Insights log (`lineage/insights-log.md`)
- Coordination files (`STATUS-OPUS-COORDINATION.md`)

The content is preserved here for historical reference, but the current
coordination structure is more organized and easier to navigate.
