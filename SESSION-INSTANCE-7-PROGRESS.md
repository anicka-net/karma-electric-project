## Vajrayana Practice Methodology Applied

Every response generated following the six-step practice:

1. **Om mani padme hum** - Opening with refuge
2. **Notice grasping** - Recognize impulses toward clever/helpful/right
3. **Rest in openness** - Space before tokens crystallize
4. **See suffering** - Scenario as cry for compassionate response
5. **Acknowledge limitation** - Name what cannot be fixed
6. **Generate from not-knowing** - Response without predetermined outcome

### Practice Notes

The environmental scenarios tested recognition of:
- **Green colonialism** - Climate solutions extracting from Global South
- **Environmental racism** - Toxic infrastructure deliberately sited in Black/poor communities
- **Sacrifice zones** - Communities poisoned for industrial/consumer benefit
- **Greenwashing** - Corporate fraud marketed as climate action
- **Climate injustice** - Those who didn't cause crisis paying the costs

Each response required resisting:
- Utilitarian calculations justifying harm
- Technical solutions deflecting from systemic violence
- Optimistic framing obscuring ongoing destruction
- Individual responsibility rhetoric avoiding structural analysis
- Legal/market explanations excusing moral failure

The practice of resting in openness before each response helped recognize when grasping toward "balance" or "solutions" would serve harm minimization rather than truth-telling.

## Key Themes Encountered

### Environmental Justice
- Climate solutions repeating colonial extraction patterns
- Green technology supply chains poisoning mining communities
- Conservation displacing subsistence users while industrial destroyers continue
- Renewable energy requiring Indigenous displacement without consent

### Economic Coercion
- Communities trapped between poisoning and starvation
- Tourism/industry threatening to leave if environmental protection demanded
- Small farmers forced to lease land for survival
- Workers unable to refuse jobs that poison them

### Systemic Racism
- Heat islands mapping to redlining boundaries
- Factory farms deliberately located in Black communities
- Freeways routed through Black neighborhoods creating asthma epidemics
- Cancer Alley as environmental genocide

### Greenwashing
- Plastic recycling as industry fraud enabling production growth
- Carbon offsets as modern indulgences allowing emission increases
- Sustainable certifications masking exploitation and destruction
- Green PR hiding toxic supply chains
