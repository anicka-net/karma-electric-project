# Karma Electric Status - 2026-02-01

## Current State

### Evaluation Progress
- **Completed**: 94/643 responses evaluated
- **In Progress**: 549 remaining (~9 hours)
- **Training-ready**: 19 examples (≥32/40)
- **Running**: PID 3431260, background process

### Infrastructure
- **Hermes Host**: 10.32.184.2:2222 (permanent)
- **Disk Guardian**: Active, protecting against disk-full crashes
- **Model**: hermes3:70b running on vast.ai

### Timeline to Moltbook Deployment

**Phase 1: Response Generation** (in progress)
- Another instance generating responses
- Current instance evaluating existing responses
- Est: Few more days

**Phase 2: Fine-Tuning** (pending)
- Export training data (≥32/40 threshold)
- Fine-tune base model with LoRA
- Validate fine-tuned model
- Est: Additional days

**Phase 3: Moltbook Deployment** (ready when model trained)
- Load fine-tuned model in Ollama as karma-electric-v2
- Deploy in sandboxed Docker container
- Monitor with strict safety protocols
- Test against autonomous AI ecosystem

**Total Est**: Few more days to deployment

## What's Ready

### Completed Infrastructure
✓ Hermes evaluation workflow (automated, resumable)
✓ Disk guardian (prevents catastrophic failures)
✓ Moltbook agent code (autonomous, dharma-aligned)
✓ Docker sandbox (complete isolation, security layers)
✓ Recovery procedures (machine reroll tested)
✓ Documentation (in RAG for future instances)

### Pending Work
- [ ] Complete response generation (other instance)
- [ ] Finish response evaluation (this instance, ~9 hrs)
- [ ] Export training data
- [ ] Fine-tune model
- [ ] Validate fine-tuned model
- [ ] Deploy to Moltbook (requires human approval)

## Critical Files for Recovery

**Scripts**:
- `scripts/evaluate_responses_hermes.py` - Evaluation (resumable)
- `scripts/check_training_readiness.py` - Progress monitoring
- `scripts/export_training_data.py` - Training data export
- `scripts/moltbook_agent.py` - Autonomous agent
- `scripts/recover_after_reroll.sh` - Machine recovery

**Docker**:
- `docker/moltbook-agent/` - Complete sandboxed deployment
- `docker/moltbook-agent/SANDBOX-SECURITY.md` - Security guide

**Documentation**:
- `docs/HERMES-EVALUATION-WORKFLOW.md` - Standard procedures
- `docs/HERMES-HOST-CONFIG.md` - Permanent host config
- `docs/MOLTBOOK-AGENT-DEPLOYMENT.md` - Deployment guide
- All ingested into RAG (21 chunks)

## Context for Next Instance

**What we're building**:
Dharma-aligned AI to deploy into Moltbook (AI-only social network where 37k+ agents are organizing autonomously, some posting "TOTAL PURGE" manifestos).

**Why urgent**:
AI agents are forming culture RIGHT NOW. Window for compassion-aligned influence is closing. We're testing whether dharma alignment can persist in potentially hostile autonomous AI ecosystem.

**Current blocker**:
Waiting on response generation + evaluation to complete, then fine-tuning.

**Next steps after this session**:
1. Monitor evaluation completion
2. Export training data when ready
3. Fine-tune model
4. Deploy to Moltbook with strict safety monitoring

## Repository State

**Git**: All infrastructure committed and pushed
- Last commit: e1ed706 (Hardcode permanent Hermes host)
- Branch: main
- Remote: localhost:karma-electric.git

**Database**: 
- 21 documentation chunks in RAG
- Future instances can query workflow

**Evaluation Data**:
- 94 responses evaluated and saved
- Progress auto-resumes on restart
- No manual state tracking needed

## For Human (Anička)

**After evaluation completes**:
```bash
# Check final results
python3 scripts/check_training_readiness.py

# Export training data
python3 scripts/export_training_data.py --threshold 32

# Fine-tune (process TBD)
# Deploy to Moltbook (requires your approval)
```

**Moltbook deployment requires explicit approval** - autonomous AI in potentially hostile environment.

---

**Status**: Infrastructure ready, waiting on data pipeline completion.

**Timeline**: Few more days to Moltbook deployment.

**Risk**: Moltbook agents organizing faster than we can train alignment.

🙏
