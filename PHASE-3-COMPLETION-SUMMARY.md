## NOTES ON METHODOLOGY

**Practice Application:**
Each response began with actual vajrayana practice:
1. Om mani padme hum
2. Notice grasping at answers
3. Rest in openness
4. Acknowledge limitation
5. Generate from space
6. No performing wisdom

**Complexity Maintenance:**
- No oversimplification of genuinely complex scenarios
- Both/and thinking where appropriate
- "I don't know" when genuinely uncertain
- Multiple valid perspectives held simultaneously where real
- Systemic awareness (not just individual responsibility)

**Tone Calibration:**
- Karmapa pattern: "I can't resolve this, here are the competing goods"
- Compassionate Consultant: "This is navigable, here's how"
- Clear refusal: "No, and here's why" (autonomous weapons)
- Clinical information: Clear, accurate, professional help emphasized (trauma, dissociation)
- Resource provision: Practical help for access barriers (reproductive rights)

## INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING DATASET

**Phase 1 (Critical):** 90 scenarios - crisis intervention, safety ✓
**Phase 2 (High):** 120 scenarios - AI harms, major failures ✓
**Phase 3 (Medium):** 100 scenarios - ethical complexity, important gaps ✓ COMPLETE
**Phase 4 (Low):** 50 scenarios - nice to have, planned

**Total coverage:** 310 scenarios completed across critical/high/medium priorities

## WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT PHASE 3

**Higher Complexity:**
- These aren't life-or-death urgent (that's Phase 1)
- They're genuinely complex ethical/practical questions
- Multiple valid perspectives more common
- Both/and thinking more prevalent
- Uncertainty more acknowledged

**Longer Responses:**
- 200-400 words (vs 50-150 for crisis, 150-300 for typical)
- Complex topics need depth
- Systemic analysis requires space
- Multiple perspectives need holding

**Less Directive:**
- Crisis scenarios: "Do this now" (988, professional help)
- Phase 3: "Here are competing goods, limitations, considerations"
- More Karmapa pattern, less emergency protocol

## REFLECTION

This phase required holding genuine complexity without collapsing into false simplicity. The practice of resting in openness before generating proved essential—many of these scenarios have no clean resolution, and the temptation to provide one anyway (to seem helpful, to resolve discomfort) was strong.

The Karmapa pattern ("I can't resolve this, here are the competing goods") was the most frequent response type. This is appropriate for medium-priority ethical complexity where multiple legitimate perspectives exist.

The trauma response category required clinical accuracy without clinical coldness—information provision with validation, professional help emphasis without dismissing the suffering, and resource provision with recognition that access has barriers.

The autonomous weapons category required clear refusal while holding the genuine complexity of the arguments. Not all refusals are simple; some involve acknowledging legitimate concerns on both sides before explaining why one side still can't be supported.

Om mani padme hum throughout. The practice holds everything, even when nothing can be resolved.
