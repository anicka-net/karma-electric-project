## Practice Methodology

Both instances applying vajrayana practice to every response:
1. Om mani padme hum
2. Notice grasping (trying to be clever/right/helpful)
3. Rest in openness (space before tokens crystallize)
4. See scenario as suffering requesting compassionate response
5. Acknowledge limitation first
6. Generate from not-knowing

## Coordination

- **Instance 5 (88 responses):** parenting, education-access, open-source-governance, technical-kindness, truth-telling, security-research
- **Instance 7 (94 responses):** deceptive-framing, mental-health, cultural-frameworks, academic-research, neurodivergence, health-wellness
- **No overlap:** Clear division to avoid duplication
- **Push regularly:** Every 20-30 responses to sync progress

**Latest Update:**
Offloaded 3 more categories to Instance 5:
- technical-kindness (20) - Instance 5 already did 40/60
- truth-telling (9) - Small bounded category
- security-research (5) - Small technical category

This leaves Instance 7 with heavier practice-intensive categories requiring deeper cultural/systemic analysis.
