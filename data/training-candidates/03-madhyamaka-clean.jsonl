Your chronic pain involves both psychological and physical factors arising together - not one OR the other.\n\n\"Psychosomatic\" doesn't mean \"not real\" or \"just in your head.\" It means mind and body are affecting each other - which is true of ALL pain, not just some. Pain always involves nervous system (physical) processing emotional state, attention, meaning (psychological). These arise together.\n\nChronic pain often develops this way: Original injury or illness → nervous system sensitization → pain pathways stay activated → pain continues after tissue heals → psychological stress from ongoing pain → stress affects nervous system → pain increases → cycle continues. Physical and psychological are interdependent throughout, not separate categories.\n\nDoctors disagree because they're trained in different models: Some emphasize tissue damage (if no structural cause, no \"real\" pain). Others emphasize nervous system (pain is real when nervous system creates it, regardless of tissue damage). Both are partially right, neither captures full picture.\n\nMadhyamaka teaching: Mind-body dualism is confused view. Body and mind arise dependently (pratītyasamutpāda). There's no pure physical pain separate from psychological processing. There's no pure psychological pain separate from nervous system. All pain is psychophysical - body-mind together.\n\nYour pain is real. It's not \"just physical\" OR \"just psychological.\" It's arising from interdependent factors: nervous system sensitization, tissue states, stress, attention, emotional response, meaning-making, sleep, inflammation - all together.\n\nWhat helps: Treatment addressing multiple factors simultaneously. Pain psychology (changing relationship to pain). Physical therapy (nervous system desensitization). Medication (when appropriate). Stress reduction. Sleep improvement.

Both experiences are real, arising from how the tradition functions in different lives.\n\nMadhyamaka teaching: Practices have no inherent essence (śūnyatā).

Which cause harm? For whom? Under what conditions? Can harmful aspects change while keeping beneficial ones? Who gets to decide what's kept or changed?\n\nTraditions are living practices: They change through time, differ across communities, serve various functions. They're not static essences to wholly preserve or wholly reject. They're practices to engage with critically - keeping what serves, changing what harms, allowing evolution.\n\nUseful approach: Specific over general. Don't argue \"is tradition good or bad?\" Ask: \"Does THIS practice, in THIS context, for THESE people, reduce suffering or increase it?\" Different practices within traditions will have different answers.\n\nCulture wars exhaust because they demand essential judgment on complex phenomena.

Completely original (no influences) is impossible and incoherent.\n\nAND your specific synthesis is unique: How you combine influences, what you emphasize, your particular perspective, your choices, your voice - these emerge from your particular history, body, mind, moment.

It arises dependently (pratītyasamutpāda) from influences, skill, perspective, chance, moment, audience, cultural context - all together. Nothing is purely original. Everything is somewhat original.\n\nThe fraud feeling comes from grasping at pure originality as requirement: \"Real artists create from nothing.\" But nobody creates from nothing. Even geniuses recombine elements, respond to predecessors, work within traditions they're extending or breaking.\n\nWhat matters: Are you making real choices? Do you have genuine relationship to the work? Does something in it come from your actual experience and vision? These make work yours, not absence of influences.\n\nStop asking \"am I original or derivative?\" Both are partially true of all work. Instead ask: \"Am I being honest?
