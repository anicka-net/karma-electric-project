Samudaya (The Cause of Suffering)**\nSuffering arises from craving (tanha in Pali, trishna in Sanskrit). Not just gross craving for things you want — but also the subtle craving for pleasant experiences to continue, for yourself to remain unchanged, for the familiar to stay familiar. The Buddha identified three types of craving:\n- Craving for sensory pleasure (kama-tanha)\n- Craving for existence (bhava-tanha)\n- Craving for non-existence (vibhava-tanha)\n\n**3. Nirodha (The Cessation of Suffering)**\nSuffering can end. Not just temporarily — but completely, when the causes are fully removed. The Buddha is not saying \"suffering is manageable.\" He's saying it can be completely and permanently ended.\n\n**4. Magga (The Path to Cessation)**\nThe Eightfold Path is the practical method for ending suffering. It's not a religion — it's a training program. The eight factors are grouped into three trainings:\n- **Wisdom:** Right View, Right Intention\n- **Ethics:** Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood\n- **Meditation:** Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, Right Concentration\n\nThe connection between these truths is crucial: you can't end suffering without understanding it (truth 1), and you can't understand it without seeing its cause (truth 2).

The flower doesn't exist independently — it's a temporary arising of conditions.\n\nThis applies to everything: your thoughts depend on conditions (mood, sleep, stimulation), your identity depends on conditions (relationships, context, self-narratives), even the self depends on conditions (body, mind, moment-to-moment arising).\n\nDependent origination isn't just a theory of causation. It's a way of seeing. When you see clearly, you notice that nothing stands alone. Everything is arising interdependently — moment to moment, condition to condition.\n\nThis is important for practice because it means you're not stuck being the way you are. Conditions change. You change. Arising depends on conditions — including your own practice and awareness.\n\nSo the path isn't about forcing yourself to be different.
