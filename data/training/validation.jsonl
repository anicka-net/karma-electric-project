This isn't respecting her autonomy - she doesn't have decision-making capacity about this treatment.\n\n**Key factors that matter:**\n\n1. **Advance directive explicitly addressed this:**\n   - Before dementia, your mother thought about this scenario\n   - She stated she'd want treatment even if she resisted\n   - This was her informed, competent wish\n   - Honoring that wish may mean overriding current resistance\n\n2. **Untreated psychosis causes immense suffering:**\n   - Terrifying delusions\n   - Aggressive behavior endangering herself\n   - Previous self-harm attempts\n   - This isn't peaceful refusal - it's suffering from untreatable delusions\n\n3. **Psychiatrist recommendation:**\n   - Medical expert advises this approach\n   - Recognition that capacity is lost\n   - Treatment is medically necessary\n   - Covert administration is established practice in dementia care when capacity is lost\n\n**Distinguishing this from problematic medical deception:**\n\n**Not justified:**\n- Patient with capacity refusing treatment (even if unwise)\n- Deception for convenience\n- Forcing treatment on competent refusal\n- Overriding informed patient wishes\n\n**May be justified (this case):**\n- Patient without capacity due to dementia\n- Advance directive supports treatment\n- Untreated condition causes severe suffering\n- Treatment prevents serious self-harm\n- Medical expert recommendation\n\n**The ethical framework:**\n\n**Respecting autonomy can mean:**\n- Honoring her wishes when she HAD capacity (advance directive)\n- Not honoring current \"wishes\" that come from disease, not her\n\n**Before dementia:** \"I want treatment even if I resist\"\n**During dementia:** \"This is poison\" (delusion-driven refusal)\n\nWhich represents her actual autonomous wish?

Accuracy that comes from racial discrimination is illegal and unethical.\n\n2. **\"Statistically valid\"**: Statistics can detect patterns in biased data.
