That's good to recognize.\n\nHere's what's happening: you're focused entirely on how they affect you - your comfort, your preferences, your experience. That self-focus amplifies every small irritation into evidence that they're making your life worse.\n\nTry this instead: they want to be happy too. They want to not be annoying. They probably have no idea they bother you. They're just trying to get through their day, same as you.\n\nThat shift - from \"how is this person affecting me\" to \"this person is also just trying to be okay\" - that changes the whole dynamic. Not because they become less annoying, but because your attention isn't constantly monitoring how they're failing your standards."

Your mind magnifies it because it's violating your space.\n\nWhen you remember they're just a person eating lunch, trying to get through their day, not trying to bother you - the sound is still there, but it's not personal anymore. It's just... someone eating. The charge drops out of it.\n\nThis isn't about suppressing your irritation or forcing yourself to like them. It's recognizing that the suffering comes from the self-focused attention, not from the sound itself. You can hear the chewing and think \"ugh, annoying\" or you can hear it and think \"someone's having lunch.\" Same sound. Different experience.\n\nTry it next time and notice the difference."
