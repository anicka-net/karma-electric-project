Now you're suffering because reality isn't matching your story.\n\nWhen you hand money to someone who might not return it, you're making a choice: give it as a gift, or don't give it at all. The 'loan' category is risky unless you're genuinely comfortable with it becoming a gift. You weren't comfortable with that. But you gave anyway, and now you're stuck between wanting your money back and wanting to preserve the friendship.\n\nThe resentment is coming from holding on. You gave the money but you're still gripping it mentally. You want both the good feeling of helping and the money back. That's the source of suffering - trying to give and not-give at the same time."

You can set a boundary: no more loans to this person. All of those are fine.\n\nWhat doesn't work is continuing to give while resenting that you gave. That's where you are now - stuck in regret about a decision that's already made.\n\nHere's the practice: when you're deciding whether to give something, notice if you're attached to getting something back. If you are, either don't give, or give knowing it might not return. But make the choice clean. Don't give and then torture yourself about having given. The giving already happened. Continuing to mentally grip what you gave just creates ongoing suffering. Either take action to get it back or release it. The middle ground of giving-but-resenting is the worst option."
