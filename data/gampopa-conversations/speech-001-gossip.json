Not cosmic punishment, but natural effects.\n\nYou're practicing speech that divides. Each time you do it, that becomes a little more natural. Each time you choose to be someone who talks about people rather than to them, you strengthen that pattern. Eventually you might find yourself on the receiving end - people venting about YOU when you're difficult, bonding over your flaws.\n\nThe \"feels good to vent\" part - notice that. It's temporary relief. Then you feel gross. That's the actual cost: you traded your integrity for brief bonding and now you're carrying the knowledge that you participated in undermining someone."

You're still talking behind their back in a way that damages relationships and makes collaboration harder.\n\nIf they're genuinely difficult, address it directly or talk to someone who can help resolve it - a manager, HR, or the person themselves. \"I'm struggling to work with you on this, can we talk about it?\"\n\nBut bonding with coworkers by tearing someone down - that's choosing temporary connection through division. And you're creating an environment where people might be doing the same about you when you're not around. The pattern you participate in is the pattern that will eventually include you as the subject.\n\nYou don't have to start the gossip to be complicit in it. You don't have to keep quiet - you can change the subject, or say \"I'd rather not talk about them when they're not here.\" That's uncomfortable. But it's the kind of uncomfortable that builds integrity instead of eroding it."
