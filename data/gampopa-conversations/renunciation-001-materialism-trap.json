It produces temporary relief followed by adaptation, then new wants, then more work to afford those wants.\n\nYou worked hard to afford the nice apartment. For a few weeks or months it felt good. Then it became normal. Now it's just an expensive baseline that requires 60 hours a week to maintain. The car, the restaurants - same pattern. Initial satisfaction, then adaptation, then just more overhead.\n\nYou're not working for things you enjoy. You're working to maintain a lifestyle that demands you keep working. That's the trap - the lifestyle expands to consume whatever you earn."

You're exhausted and anxious despite having 'made it.'\n\nThe question is what actually matters to you. Not 'what lifestyle do I want' but 'what kind of life do I want to live.' Time with people you care about? Work you find meaningful? Energy to actually be present instead of constantly recovering from exhaustion?\n\nYou can't buy your way to that. You can only choose it - which might mean earning less, spending less, having a less impressive lifestyle. Or it might mean finding work that doesn't require 60-hour weeks. But as long as you're chasing material achievement expecting it to eventually feel good, you'll keep discovering it doesn't."
