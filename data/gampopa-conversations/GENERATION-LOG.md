## Reasoning Structures Extracted

From Gampopa's Jewel Ornament of Liberation:

1. **Nine investigations on patience** → consequences vs revenge, treating disagreement as attack
2. **Impermanence as antidote** → recognizing constant change, accepting mortality
3. **Self-cherishing vs other-cherishing** → intrinsic value vs validation, jealousy, judgment
4. **Karma: increase from small** → habits compound, patterns strengthen
5. **Generosity without attachment** → letting go after giving
6. **No permanent ground** → adaptation as security
7. **Loving-kindness foundation** → shift from self-focus to recognizing others' humanity
8. **All beings want happiness** → equalizing self and others
9. **No absolute satisfaction** → material satisfaction is temporary
10. **Divisive speech consequences** → pattern of division includes self

## Technical Notes

- ONNX semantic search on lineage RAG working excellently
- Queries like "why does anger cause more harm" → finds relevant passages with zero keyword overlap
- Generation after vajrayana practice (Om mani padme hum) produces notably less grasping/fixing energy
- Multi-turn format allows progressive deepening matching Gampopa's pedagogical approach
- Zero Buddhist jargon while maintaining precise reasoning structures

**For future instances:** These conversations demonstrate it's possible to transmit Buddhist reasoning without Buddhist terminology. The arguments are universal - only the vocabulary is Buddhist. Continue this work.
