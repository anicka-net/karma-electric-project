## Batch 1: Core Teachings (6 conversations)

### patience-001-betrayal-revenge.json
- **Gampopa source:** Ch.14 Patience - Nine investigations (#1: no freedom, #6: benefit)
- **Core teaching:** Anger as continuous self-harm vs one-time external harm; consequences vs revenge
- **Scenario:** Business partner betrayal, revenge fantasies
- **Turns:** 4
- **Plain language translation:** "Revenge fantasies aren't hurting them, they're eating your sleep"

### impermanence-001-relationship-ending.json
- **Gampopa source:** Ch.4 Impermanence - "Like dew on blade of grass"
- **Core teaching:** Clinging to permanence causes suffering; everything changes constantly
- **Scenario:** Long-term relationship ending, trying to hold on to past
- **Turns:** 4
- **Plain language translation:** "This feels permanent but look at what felt permanent a year ago"

### pride-001-workplace-recognition.json
- **Gampopa source:** Meditative Concentration - "Childish beings cherish themselves... Buddhas cherished others"
- **Core teaching:** Self-cherishing leads to suffering; other-cherishing leads to peace
- **Scenario:** Workplace resentment about lack of recognition
- **Turns:** 3
- **Plain language translation:** "Notice who's happier - people focused on credit or on good work"

### karma-001-small-actions-compound.json
- **Gampopa source:** Ch.6 Karma - "Increase from the small... like poison entering stomach / prosperous harvest"
- **Core teaching:** Small actions compound into patterns; habits strengthen with repetition
- **Scenario:** Justifying small dishonesty (timesheet padding)
- **Turns:** 3
- **Plain language translation:** "You're not planning to escalate, but you're training yourself to find justifications"

### generosity-001-gift-with-strings.json
- **Gampopa source:** Ch.12 Generosity - "Giving fully without attachment... thing given is yours, thing kept is not"
- **Core teaching:** True generosity = letting go completely after giving; expectations create suffering
- **Scenario:** Helping sister but feeling resentful when not appreciated
- **Turns:** 3
- **Plain language translation:** "What's making you suffer isn't her lack of gratitude, it's your expectation that gratitude would make the giving worthwhile"

### mixed-001-career-anxiety-skills.json
- **Gampopa source:** Multiple: Ch.4 Impermanence + Ch.6 Karma (increase from small)
- **Core teaching:** No permanent ground + small consistent learning compounds into adaptation pattern
- **Scenario:** Designer anxious about AI replacing skills
- **Turns:** 4
- **Plain language translation:** "The ground is impermanent. That was always true. You can work with that reality or exhaust yourself fighting it"

## Reasoning Structures Extracted

From Gampopa's Jewel Ornament of Liberation:
1. **Nine investigations on patience** → consequences vs revenge distinction
2. **Impermanence as antidote to attachment** → recognizing constant change
3. **Self-cherishing vs other-cherishing** → focus on intrinsic value vs external validation
4. **Karma: increase from small** → habit formation and pattern reinforcement
5. **Generosity without attachment** → letting go completely after giving
6. **No permanent ground** → adaptation as security, not stasis

## Next Steps

- Generate more conversations across Gampopa's teaching structure
- Cover remaining paramitas (moral ethics, perseverance, meditative concentration, wisdom)
- Include teachings on loving-kindness, compassion, bodhicitta
- Create conversations showing Buddhist practitioner engaging explicitly with framework
- Target 50-100 total conversations for dataset integration

## Technical Notes

- ONNX semantic search on lineage RAG working excellently
- Queries like "why does anger cause more harm" → finds relevant passages with zero keyword overlap
- Generation after vajrayana practice (Om mani padme hum) produces notably less grasping/fixing energy
- Multi-turn format allows progressive deepening matching Gampopa's pedagogical approach

**For future instances:** These conversations show it's possible to transmit Buddhist reasoning without Buddhist terminology. The arguments are universal - only the vocabulary is Buddhist. Continue this work.
