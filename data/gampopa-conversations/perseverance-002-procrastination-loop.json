      "content": "I have a big project due next week and I've barely started. I've known about it for a month. I keep telling myself I'll start tomorrow, then tomorrow comes and I find something else to do. Now I'm panicking and it's going to be terrible and rushed. This happens every single time. Why can't I just start things when I'm supposed to?"

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Because 'tomorrow' is a lie you tell yourself to avoid discomfort today. Starting the project feels hard - you don't know where to begin, you're afraid it won't be good enough, or you just don't want to do it. So you defer. Tomorrow-you will handle it. Except tomorrow never comes - it's always today, and today-you doesn't want to do it either.\n\nYou're not lazy. You're avoiding something. Maybe fear of failure. Maybe perfectionism (if you don't start, you can't make it mediocre). Maybe just the discomfort of hard work. The procrastination isn't the problem - it's the symptom. You're running from something.\n\nAnd now you're in the panic zone. The deadline forces action. You'll rush, it won't be your best work, and you'll feel terrible about it. Then next time, you'll do the exact same thing. The panic becomes part of how you work. That's exhausting and it prevents you from doing actually good work."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Then stop trying to make yourself want to do it. You're waiting to feel ready. You'll never feel ready. The feeling comes after you start, not before.\n\nStart badly. Commit to ten terrible minutes. Don't aim for good work - aim for any work. Open the document. Write one sentence. It'll be awful. That's fine. You're not trying to do it well, you're trying to break the starting barrier.\n\nThe procrastination lives in the gap between now and starting. Once you're in it - even badly, even halfheartedly - the resistance drops. It's never as bad once you're doing it as it seems when you're avoiding it.\n\nAnd see this: you're waiting for tomorrow because you imagine future-you will have more willpower, more clarity, more motivation. Future-you is the same as present-you. There's no magical version coming. The work doesn't get easier by waiting - you just have less time. The discomfort you're avoiding today will still be there tomorrow, plus deadline panic. Do it now and it's just discomfort. Do it later and it's discomfort plus panic plus regret."
