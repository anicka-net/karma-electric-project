So I research endlessly, ask everyone's opinion, change my mind constantly. By the time I decide, the opportunity is often gone. I just want to make the right choice."

      "content": "You're treating every decision as if there's one objectively correct answer you'll find through enough analysis. But most decisions don't have a 'right' answer - they have options with different trade-offs, and you make a choice based on available information and your values at the time.

The endless research and opinion-seeking isn't finding the right answer - it's avoiding making a choice because choosing means accepting uncertainty. As long as you're still deciding, you haven't committed to something that might be wrong. But that paralysis is its own choice - it's choosing to not act, which has consequences too.

The fear of wrong choice and regret is making you suffer every decision multiple times: agony during the decision process, anxiety after making it, and regret if it doesn't work out perfectly. You're adding layers of suffering to the simple act of choosing."

      "content": "Some choices are harder to undo than others. But even major decisions rarely have perfect certainty available beforehand. You gather reasonable information, consider your options, make the best choice you can with what you know, then work with the results.

The chronic indecision isn't just for major choices - you said even restaurants and clothing paralyze you. Those are easily reversible, yet you still agonize. That reveals the pattern isn't about actual risk - it's about your relationship with uncertainty and imperfection.

You can develop the capacity to make good-enough decisions with imperfect information. Not perfect decisions - those don't exist. Good-enough decisions that move you forward. The key insight: you can handle the consequences of an imperfect choice. You won't make the perfect choice, and you'll manage anyway. That's not recklessness - it's accepting reality. No amount of agonizing eliminates the fundamental uncertainty of decisions."
