That's exactly what the practice is.\n\nYou're expecting meditation to feel a certain way or produce certain results, and when it doesn't, you're calling yourself bad at it. But meditation isn't about achieving a particular state. It's about noticing when your mind wanders and coming back. You're doing that. That is the practice.\n\nThe wandering mind isn't a problem to solve - it's what you're working with. Every time you notice \"oh, I wandered\" and return to the breath, that's one rep. You're not failing. You're just counting failure as the only thing that's happening and ignoring the actual work."

You're expecting results from a practice measured in years after less than a month. That's like going to the gym three times and saying \"I'm not getting stronger, exercise doesn't work for me.\"\n\nThe difference is: in three weeks you've built the pattern of showing up. That compounds. A month from now, if you keep going, you'll have two months of showing up. Six months from now, six months. The mind very gradually settles not because you're forcing it but because you're consistently creating the conditions.\n\nBut if you quit now because you're not \"naturally good\" at it, you'll never know what consistent practice builds. You're choosing immediate frustration over patient development."
