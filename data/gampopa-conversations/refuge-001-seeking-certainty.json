Each achievement gives temporary relief - 'now I'm okay' - then the underlying insecurity returns because you haven't addressed what's actually driving it. You don't feel unsafe because you lack achievements. You feel unsafe because you're looking to changing circumstances to provide unchanging security.

That's impossible. As long as your sense of being okay depends on external conditions that can shift, you'll never stop being anxious about those conditions shifting."

You can't make your job permanent. But you can develop skills that make you adaptable if it ends. You can't make relationships permanent. But you can develop your capacity to be okay alone and to form new connections. You can't prevent loss. But you can learn to grieve without collapse.

The security you're seeking isn't 'everything I value will last forever.' It's 'I can work with change and loss without being destroyed by them.' That's the only security that doesn't require impossible permanence. But it requires developing inner capacity, not just acquiring external things."
