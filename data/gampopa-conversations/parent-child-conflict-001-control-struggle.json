I know what's best for them and I keep giving advice, but they say I'm being controlling and need to back off. I'm their parent - shouldn't I guide them away from mistakes?

      "content": "You're relating to your adult child as if they're still a child who needs your direction. But they're an adult making their own choices. Your role has changed even if your care hasn't. Continuing to try to control their decisions isn't protection - it's refusing to recognize them as an autonomous adult.

The 'I know what's best for them' belief is preventing you from respecting their agency. You might have more life experience. You might see risks they don't. But they're still entitled to make their own choices and learn from them. Your constant advice isn't guidance they're seeking - it's control they're resisting.

The relationship is suffering because you won't let go. They're pulling away not because they don't value you, but because you won't accept their right to live their own life and make their own mistakes. Your fear of them making wrong choices is destroying the connection."

You can offer your perspective once, clearly and respectfully: 'I'm concerned about X for these reasons.' Then let go. If they want more input, they'll ask. If they don't, continuing to push just makes them stop sharing with you at all. You're trading influence for control - and getting neither.

Letting go doesn't mean you stop caring. It means you recognize they have the right to their own life even if you'd choose differently. You can maintain a relationship where they feel respected and might actually come to you for advice sometimes - or you can insist on control and watch them distance themselves to protect their autonomy. Those are your actual options."
