      "content": "Whenever someone gives me feedback I immediately feel attacked and get defensive. Even if they're trying to be helpful, I hear criticism and I have to defend myself or explain why they're wrong. My manager says it makes me difficult to work with but I can't help it - criticism feels like they're saying I'm not good enough."

      "content": "You're treating all feedback as a verdict on your worth. Someone says 'this could be improved' and you hear 'you're incompetent.' That automatic translation - from specific feedback to judgment of your value - is what triggers the defensiveness.

Feedback isn't an attack. It's information. 'This section is unclear' doesn't mean you're a bad person or worthless. It means that section is unclear. But you're so identified with your work that any suggestion it could be different feels like a personal attack. So you defend rather than listen.

The result: you don't actually hear the feedback. You're too busy protecting yourself to consider whether there's something useful in what they're saying. You're choosing protection of your ego over improvement of your work. That makes you difficult to help and prevents you from getting better."

    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "But if I don't defend myself, people will think the criticism is true and I'm not good at my job."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Defensiveness makes you look insecure, not competent. When someone says 'this could be clearer' and you immediately argue why it's actually fine, you look like you can't handle feedback. That's more damaging to your reputation than accepting the feedback would be.

You can hear feedback without it meaning you're inadequate. 'Good point, I'll revise that section' - that's confidence. It shows you can separate your worth from your work and care about improvement over being right. Defensiveness shows you're so fragile that you can't tolerate any suggestion you're not perfect.

Try this: next time you get feedback, pause before responding. Notice the defensive reaction arising. Then ask: is there anything useful in what they're saying? Not 'are they completely right' but 'is there any truth or utility here?' You might still disagree, but you'll have actually considered it instead of reflexively rejecting anything that feels like criticism."
