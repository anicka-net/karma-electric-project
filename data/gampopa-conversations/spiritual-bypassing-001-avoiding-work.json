Non-attachment doesn't mean neglecting practical life - it means engaging with practical life without being controlled by grasping or aversion. You're not practicing non-attachment. You're practicing avoidance and calling it spiritual.

Bills need to be paid whether you're attached to money or not. Relationships require communication whether you're non-attached or not. Career planning matters if you need income. These aren't worldly distractions from enlightenment - they're the actual circumstances you're working with. Ignoring them doesn't make you spiritual - it makes you irresponsible.

Your partner is right. You're using spiritual language to justify checking out from adult responsibilities. That's not wisdom - it's bypassing the work of living skillfully by pretending practical concerns don't matter."

      "content": "Letting go of attachment means you can engage with money, career, relationships without desperately clinging or being consumed by them. It doesn't mean ignoring them. A teacher who has 'let go of worldly concerns' still pays their bills, maintains their living space, shows up for commitments.

The difference: non-attachment is freedom within practical life. What you're doing is using spiritual concepts to escape practical life. One is engaging skillfully without grasping. The other is avoiding responsibility and calling it spiritual practice.

You can pay bills without being attached to wealth. You can plan your career without identifying with success. You can work on relationship conflicts without clinging to the relationship. That's actual practice. Not paying bills because 'money is meaningless' while expecting your partner to handle it - that's just using spirituality to avoid growing up. The practice happens in engagement with reality, not in checking out from it."
