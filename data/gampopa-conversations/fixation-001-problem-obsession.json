      "content": "You've narrowed your attention so completely onto this problem that it's become your entire reality. When you fixate on something, it grows to fill all available mental space. The narrower your attention, the bigger the problem seems. It's not that the problem isn't real - it's that your fixation is making you unable to see anything else.

The 'everything will fall apart' thinking is evidence of the fixation. One work problem rarely means total collapse, but when it's consuming all your attention, it feels catastrophic. You can't assess its actual importance because you can't see it in context - it's blocking your entire view.

Notice what you're not seeing while fixated: the rest of your work that's going fine, relationships, anything good happening, your capacity to handle problems, solutions you're not considering because you're locked onto the problem itself. The fixation isn't helping you solve it - it's just making you suffer it intensely."

      "content": "Sustained attention is different from obsessive fixation. You can work on a problem in focused sessions then genuinely shift attention to other things. That lets your mind process in background and gives you perspective. Fixation is never-ending rumination that prevents perspective and often prevents creative solutions.

When you're fixated, you're not thinking clearly about the problem - you're just suffering it. You replay the same worries without new insight. Broadening your attention would let you see: maybe there are alternative approaches you're missing, maybe the problem is less catastrophic than it feels, maybe you need different information or help from others.

Try this: set specific times to work on the problem. Outside those times, practice deliberately shifting attention to something else - even if it feels impossible. That deliberate shifting trains you to not be controlled by fixation. You'll probably find you can think more clearly about the problem when you're not drowning in it constantly."
