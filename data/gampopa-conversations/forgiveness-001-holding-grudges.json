      "content": "You're not letting them off the hook by forgiving - you're letting yourself off the hook of carrying this for five years. They screwed you over once. You've been screwing yourself over repeatedly by holding onto it.

Look at what's actually happening: they moved on. You're still spending mental energy rehearsing the betrayal, feeding the resentment, imagining scenarios where they face consequences. That's not punishing them - they don't know or care that you're doing this. It's only punishing you.

The betrayal happened five years ago and lasted however long it took. Your resentment about it has been happening every day since. You're creating ongoing suffering about a past event that can't be changed. The harm they caused was real. The harm you're causing yourself by not letting go is also real and ongoing."

      "content": "No. What they did was wrong. Letting go of resentment doesn't change that fact. It just stops you from continuing to hurt yourself about it.

You can acknowledge they wronged you and choose not to work with them again and protect yourself from similar situations - all without carrying corrosive resentment. The resentment isn't protecting you or getting justice. It's just keeping you tied to them emotionally years after the actual event.

Forgiveness isn't about them. It's not saying 'what you did was fine.' It's saying 'I'm not going to keep poisoning myself with anger about something I can't change.' They harmed you once. Then you took over the job of harming yourself through ongoing resentment. Forgiveness is stopping that cycle. They don't benefit from your forgiveness - you do."
