      "content": "You're operating from 'I worked hard therefore I deserve reward.' But hard work doesn't entitle you to specific outcomes. It might increase the likelihood, but it doesn't guarantee promotion, recognition, or fairness. You're treating your effort as a contract that reality is violating.

The company made a decision based on factors you don't control - politics, timing, who they think fits their needs. That's not a cosmic injustice. It's just a decision that didn't favor you. Your hard work still had effects - skills developed, projects completed, money earned. It just didn't produce the specific reward you decided it should.

The resentment comes from the entitlement: 'I did X therefore I should get Y.' But reality doesn't operate on your sense of deservingness. When you make your peace dependent on getting what you think you've earned, you'll constantly be resentful when circumstances don't align with your scorecard."

      "content": "Not saying accept unfair treatment. Saying your sense of being owed something is creating your suffering, not just the circumstances. You can advocate for yourself, negotiate for what you want, or leave for a place that values you better - those are all responses to circumstances.

But the entitlement - 'I sacrificed therefore they owe me' - that's what's making you bitter. You chose to work hard and sacrifice personal life. Those were your choices. The company didn't force you. Now you're holding them responsible for compensating you according to your internal scorecard of what you're owed.

You can work hard because the work itself is worthwhile, develop skills for your own benefit, and negotiate for what you want - all without the story that you've earned specific treatment. When you let go of 'I deserve X,' you can assess reality clearly: does this place value my work enough? If not, what are my options? That's empowered. Entitled resentment just makes you stuck and bitter."
