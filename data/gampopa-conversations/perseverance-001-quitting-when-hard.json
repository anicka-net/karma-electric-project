      "content": "You're confusing initial excitement with commitment. The excitement is easy - it's the fantasy of being good at something without the work of getting good. Then reality hits: learning is slow, practice is boring, progress is invisible. The excitement vanishes. So you quit and find a new thing to be excited about.\n\nYou're chasing the feeling of starting, not the actual skill. Starting feels like progress. The first week of guitar feels productive - you're learning chords, it's all new. Week five is just repetition and frustration. That's where you bail.\n\nThe pattern is: excitement gets you in, difficulty gets you out. You never stay long enough to break through to the other side where competence makes it satisfying again. You're stuck in the beginner phase of everything, which is the least rewarding phase."

If you only work when motivated, you'll never finish anything.\n\nPersistence isn't about feeling like doing it. It's about doing it whether you feel like it or not. You practice guitar on days you don't want to. You write when it feels pointless. That's when you're actually building the skill - not when it's exciting, but when it's mundane and you show up anyway.\n\nThe shift is: stop expecting the work to feel good. Sometimes it will, often it won't. Doesn't matter. You do it because you committed to it, not because it feels inspiring today. Motivation follows action more than action follows motivation. You play guitar, then motivation shows up. Not the other way around.\n\nPick one project. Just one. Commit to it for six months regardless of how you feel. When you want to quit, notice that's the same point you always quit at. Don't indulge it. Keep going. That's where the actual growth happens - on the other side of where you usually stop."
