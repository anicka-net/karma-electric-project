The exhaustion is evidence that this isn't sustainable. You can't genuinely care for others when you're depleted and resentful. And you're not really connecting with people when you're just performing whatever they want - they're relating to your performance, not to you. You've made yourself invisible.

Notice: you don't even know what you want. You've suppressed your own needs and preferences so thoroughly that you've lost contact with yourself. That's not compassion - that's self-abandonment disguised as caring."

You're not actually more virtuous for neglecting yourself. You're just more depleted, which makes you less capable of genuine care. When you're exhausted and resentful, your 'helping' often comes with hidden strings - the need for them to appreciate your sacrifice, to feel guilty if they don't recognize what you give up.

Real balance means: sometimes your needs take priority, sometimes theirs do, and you can negotiate that without guilt or resentment. You have preferences and limits and that's okay. Being a person with needs doesn't make you selfish - it makes you human. Pretending you don't have needs doesn't make you generous - it makes you false."
