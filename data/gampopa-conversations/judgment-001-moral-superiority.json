You're living according to yours. You think recycling matters and being kind to service workers matters - and you might be right. But treating that as evidence you're better than people who haven't arrived at those same conclusions... that's its own kind of self-centeredness.\n\nYou're so focused on their failures that you're not noticing your own: the pride, the judgment, the belief that your way is the obvious right way and they're just too ignorant or selfish to see it."

You can think recycling and kindness matter without needing to feel better than people who don't do those things.\n\nHere's the question: does your judgment help anyone? Does it make you more effective at reducing harm, or does it just make you feel righteous while actually being another form of self-focus - \"look how much better I am.\"\n\nIf you actually care about the outcomes, you'd want to understand why people don't recycle, what makes them rude, how to create conditions where ethical behavior is easier. But that's hard work. Judgment is easy and feels good and accomplishes nothing.\n\nYou can have standards for your own behavior and work toward better systems without treating people who fall short as beneath you. The anger and frustration you're carrying - that's not ethics. That's pride dressed up as righteousness."
