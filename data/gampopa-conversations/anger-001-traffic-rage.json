The cut-off happened. It's over. But you're keeping it alive by replaying it, rehearsing confrontations, stoking your righteousness. The initial incident isn't hurting you anymore - your anger about it is.

Notice: they're probably not thinking about it at all. They might not have even realized they cut you off. You're the only one suffering from your rage. You're punishing yourself for their bad driving."

You're framing this as 'they deserve consequences' but you're the one experiencing the consequences. Your elevated heart rate, your ruined mood, your distraction for the next twenty minutes - that's all self-inflicted. They're not learning anything from your rage because they can't even see it.

If the driving was actually dangerous, you could report it. But the anger fantasy - the imaginary confrontation, the rehearsed righteousness - that's not about safety or justice. That's you feeding your sense of being wronged. And every minute you spend on that is a minute you're choosing to suffer over something that's already done."
