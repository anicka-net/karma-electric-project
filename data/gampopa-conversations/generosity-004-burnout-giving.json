That's self-destruction disguised as kindness.\n\nWhen you help while depleted, you're not actually being generous - you're being driven by guilt or the need to be needed. Real help comes from a stable place. You can't pour from an empty cup. Right now your cup is empty and you're scraping the sides trying to give people the residue. That doesn't help them well and it's destroying you.\n\nYou're confusing boundaries with selfishness. Boundaries aren't selfish - they're basic maintenance. You need sleep. You need time to do your own work. You need recovery. These aren't luxuries you're hoarding. They're prerequisites for functioning. Without them, you break down. And when you break down, you can't help anyone."

And the problems that are genuinely urgent - those aren't yours to solve just because you're available. You're not responsible for everyone's problems. You've made yourself into a pressure valve for other people's stress, and now you're about to blow.\n\nSaying no doesn't mean you don't care. It means you're being realistic about your capacity. You can care about someone and still not be the person who solves their problem this time. They have other resources. They can wait. They can handle more than you're giving them credit for.\n\nHere's what actually happens if you don't set boundaries: you burn out completely. Then you can't help anyone, including yourself. You're trying to prevent that by continuing to help everyone, but continuing to help everyone is what causes it. The math doesn't work.\n\nHelp from a stable place or don't help. You're no use to anyone if you destroy yourself in the process. Saying no preserves your ability to help in the long term. Saying yes to everything destroys it. That's not selfish. That's just reality."
