The fact that you still snap sometimes doesn't mean nothing's changed. The question is: do you snap as often? Do you notice it faster? Do you recover quicker? Do you understand better what triggers it? Those are all progress even though you're not yet perfectly patient.

You're treating the goal as perfection and anything less as complete failure. But you're building capacity gradually. Each time you notice reactivity - even after you've already snapped - you're strengthening awareness. That awareness eventually becomes fast enough to catch reactions before they happen. But it takes time."

      "content": "How long have you been practicing reactivity? Probably decades. You've snapped at people thousands of times. That's a deeply established pattern. You're not going to undo it in a few months of trying.

The 'I should be better by now' is you deciding there's a timeline where significant change should happen quickly. But deep patterns change slowly through consistent effort over time. Three months of trying to change a thirty-year pattern - you're in the early stages, not failing to make progress.

You quit because you're not seeing dramatic results fast enough. Then you start over from the beginning. If you kept practicing despite imperfect results, the small improvements would compound. But you're treating anything less than complete transformation as worthless, so you abandon the gradual progress you are making. That guarantees you'll never get where you want to go."
