      "content": "You're in a difficult position - real harm from someone with power over you. The anger is appropriate - they're treating you poorly. The question is how to address it without being consumed by anger or making yourself more vulnerable.

First: document everything. Keep records of the public criticism, ideas taken, undermining comments. Not to feed your anger, but to have evidence if you need it. Second: consider whether this is addressable - can you have a direct conversation, go to HR, find an ally with influence? Sometimes yes, sometimes the power dynamic makes that impossible or risky.

The hardest part: if you can't change the situation immediately, can you work toward leaving while not letting the anger destroy you in the meantime? The smiling and taking it approach is making you bitter. But neither is pure rage helpful. You need clear-eyed assessment: what can I do, what can't I do, how do I protect myself while I figure out next steps?"

      "content": "Standing up for yourself is important when it's effective and safe. But if the power dynamic means standing up gets you fired or retaliated against without changing their behavior, you're not actually protecting yourself - you're sacrificing yourself to make a point.

There's no moral victory in staying in a toxic situation that's damaging you. Leaving isn't letting them win - it's refusing to keep losing. They don't care if you stay and suffer. You staying while angry and powerless doesn't hurt them. It hurts you.

You can stand up for yourself by: documenting and reporting if that's viable, setting whatever small boundaries you can, and making a plan to get out. Sometimes the strongest move is walking away from a situation that can't be fixed. Save your energy for building toward something better rather than fighting a battle where the deck is stacked against you. That's not weakness - it's strategy."
