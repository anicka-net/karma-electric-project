      "content": "You're not preparing for problems - you're suffering them in advance, often multiple times for things that never happen. Each worry scenario isn't preparation, it's you creating and experiencing a painful imaginary future. You're living the loss of your job, the illness, the breakup mentally, even though none of those things are happening right now.

The worry feels productive because it mimics preparation. But rehearsing catastrophe isn't the same as actually being prepared. Worry doesn't give you useful skills or information - it just makes you suffer hypothetical problems that may never materialize.

Right now, in this actual moment, you probably have a job, health, and a relationship. But you're not experiencing those. You're experiencing imaginary futures where you've lost them. You're trading your actual present for suffering about invented problems."

      "content": "Bad things happen whether you worry about them or not. But worrying doesn't prepare you - it just makes you suffer the same event multiple times: every time you worry about it, plus if it actually happens.

Real preparation is practical: having savings, maintaining relationships, developing skills. That builds capacity to handle difficulties. Worry is just suffering about possibilities. It doesn't make you more ready - it makes you more anxious and depleted.

Most things you worry about won't happen. So you're suffering for nothing. The things that do happen often aren't what you worried about. So all that rehearsal was wasted. And when something actually difficult does occur, you handle it in the moment with whatever resources you have then - the worry beforehand doesn't help.

You can be prepared without constantly suffering imaginary futures. Save money without rehearsing poverty. Value relationships without imagining their loss. That's preparation without worry."
