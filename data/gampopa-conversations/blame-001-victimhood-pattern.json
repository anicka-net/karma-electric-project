That framing makes you powerless - if bad things happen because of external forces you can't control, there's nothing you can do except wait for better luck.\n\nBut look at the pattern: multiple bad managers, multiple flaky friends, repeatedly getting 'screwed over.' At some point you have to ask what role you're playing in these situations. Not 'you deserve it' but 'what are you doing that keeps producing similar outcomes?'\n\nMaybe you're not vetting people well. Maybe you're ignoring red flags. Maybe you're not addressing small problems before they become big ones. Maybe your standards are unclear or your boundaries are weak. The constant is you - which means you have agency to change the pattern."

      "content": "Not saying people treating you badly is your fault. Saying the repeating pattern suggests you're contributing to it somehow - and that's good news because it means you can change it.\n\nIf bad luck randomly strikes you despite perfect choices, you're helpless. But if your choices or patterns contribute to the outcomes, you can examine and change those choices. That's not blame - that's recognizing agency.\n\nMaybe the bad managers were obviously problematic in interviews but you took the job anyway. Maybe the flaky friends showed inconsistency early but you invested anyway. You don't control their behavior - but you control who you choose, how you respond, whether you stay, whether you address problems directly.\n\nThe victim framing protects you from responsibility but it also keeps you stuck. 'People keep screwing me over' means waiting for better people to show up. 'I keep choosing or tolerating people who screw me over' means examining your selection process and boundaries."
