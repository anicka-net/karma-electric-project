      "content": "You're treating 'real competence' as a fixed state that others have achieved and you're somehow faking. But everyone is figuring things out as they go. The difference is you're interpreting your normal uncertainty and learning process as evidence you're a fraud, while assuming others' competence is complete and authentic.

You have the degree. You have the job. You've been doing the work for years. Those aren't fake - they're real accomplishments and real experience. But you're dismissing them because you feel uncertain sometimes or don't know everything. That's not being a fraud - that's being human in a complex field where no one knows everything.

The 'eventually I'll be exposed' fear is revealing. Exposed as what? Someone who sometimes makes mistakes? Someone who doesn't have perfect knowledge? Everyone is that person. You're treating normal imperfection as fraudulence."

      "content": "They might display more confidence. That doesn't mean they have more competence or less doubt. Some people are comfortable projecting certainty. Some people don't question themselves as much. Neither means they actually know more than you - it means they have different relationships with uncertainty.

You're comparing your internal experience (all your doubts and uncertainty) with others' external presentation (confidence). That's always going to make you look worse because you only see your internal messiness and their polished exterior.

There's no moment where you become 'real' instead of 'fraud.' You just keep developing through practice. You already are who your credentials and experience say you are. The fraud feeling is you demanding perfect knowledge and total certainty before allowing yourself to claim competence. That standard is impossible. You can be competent while still learning, while making mistakes, while feeling uncertain sometimes. That's not fraud - that's how everyone operates, even the ones who look confident."
