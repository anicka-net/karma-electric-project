They want basic dignity. Whether giving money helps in the way you'd prefer isn't really the point - they're suffering right now, and you're calculating optimal intervention strategies.\n\nYou don't have to give money if you're genuinely concerned it won't help. But you could acknowledge their humanity - eye contact, a kind word, treating them as a person not a problem. You could keep granola bars to offer. You could volunteer once a month at a shelter. You could do something that isn't nothing.\n\nThe question isn't \"can I fix homelessness.\" It's \"am I willing to respond to suffering in front of me, in whatever small way I actually can?\""

The person you see every morning in the same spot - you could learn their name. You could bring them coffee once a week. Small, specific, sustained.\n\nThe line isn't about who deserves help or who you can save. It's about whether you're living as someone who responds to suffering when you encounter it, or someone who has good reasons why you don't have to.\n\nYour guilt isn't telling you to solve homelessness. It's telling you that walking past human suffering every day while doing nothing is affecting who you're becoming. You can either change your behavior or keep carrying that weight."
