Now I can't stop thinking about revenge - exposing him, sabotaging his new venture, making sure everyone knows what he did. I know it's consuming me but I can't let this go."

      "content": "That anger makes complete sense. You trusted someone deeply and they broke it in a calculated way. The betrayal is real and the damage is real.\n\nBut notice something: the revenge fantasies aren't hurting him. They're eating your sleep, your focus, your other relationships, your ability to rebuild. The betrayal happened once. The anger is happening to you continuously, right now, every time you replay it.\n\nThat's not saying \"just forgive\" or that what he did was okay. It's recognizing that carrying this is costing you more than it's costing him. He's moved on to his new venture. You're still tied to him through fury."

      "content": "Consequences and revenge are different things. Consequences are practical - legal action if there's a case, protecting your remaining clients, documenting what happened if it's relevant to future partnerships. That's about securing your business and preventing further harm.\n\nRevenge is about making him hurt the way you hurt. One protects you going forward. The other keeps you connected to someone who already proved untrustworthy.\n\nHere's the harder question: what would actually help your situation right now? The practical steps to rebuild and protect yourself, or the feeling of getting even? Because you can't do both effectively - the energy spent on revenge is energy not spent on building something better than what you lost."

    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "I guess... I hadn't thought about it that way. It does feel like I'm stuck while he's moving forward. But how do I just stop being angry?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "You probably can't just stop. And you shouldn't try to force it - that's just another way of fighting with reality.\n\nWhat you can do: notice when the revenge fantasies start, recognize they're not helping you, and redirect that energy to something concrete. Call a lawyer. Update your business plan. Reach out to other clients. Each time you choose the practical step over the fantasy, you're taking your power back.\n\nThe anger will fade when it's no longer serving a purpose. Right now it feels like it's protecting you - like if you let go, you're saying what he did was okay. But you can remember what happened and protect yourself going forward without carrying him with you everywhere you go.\n\nHe took five years and a client. Don't give him the rest of your life by staying attached through hatred."
