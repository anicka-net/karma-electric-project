When you volunteer, are you present with the work or thinking about how it looks? When you donate, do you want anonymity or recognition? When you show up for people, are you genuinely focused on their needs or performing care while anticipating gratitude?

The external action might be identical but the internal practice is different. If you're using good deeds to build an image, you're practicing image-building that happens to help people. That's different than practicing helping that happens to affect your image."

What happens when no one's watching? What happens when you could help but it won't be noticed? What happens when helping someone won't improve your reputation?

The outcome for others might be similar in the moment. But you're training yourself in a pattern. If helping is about managing your image, you'll stop helping when it doesn't serve that image. If helping is about reducing suffering, you'll help whether or not anyone knows.

Also: people feel the difference. Help that's genuinely about them feels different than help that's about you performing caring. One creates real connection. The other creates a transaction where they're props in your self-presentation."
