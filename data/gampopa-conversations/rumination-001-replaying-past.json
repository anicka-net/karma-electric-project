      "content": "I replay conversations from days or weeks ago, thinking about what I should have said, how I came across wrong, what the other person must have thought. I can't let things go.

      "content": "You're treating rumination as problem-solving, but it's not. You're not gaining insight through the hundredth replay of a conversation. You're just suffering it repeatedly. The interaction happened, it's done, and replaying it in your mind doesn't change what occurred or prepare you for anything useful.

The rumination keeps the past alive and painful. Each time you replay it, you're experiencing the discomfort again - the embarrassment, the anxiety about how you came across, the wish you'd done differently. The original interaction might have been briefly uncomfortable. You've now suffered it dozens of times through replaying.

Notice: the analyzing doesn't actually resolve anything. You don't finish a replay session and think 'okay, now I have clarity and can let it go.' You just feel worse and more convinced something went wrong. Then you replay it again looking for what you missed. It's an endless loop that produces suffering without producing resolution."

      "content": "You can extract a lesson without endless rumination. 'I should have been more direct' - that's a lesson. Spending hours replaying the exact conversation, imagining different versions, worrying about what they thought - that's not learning, that's torturing yourself.

Learning would be: notice what happened, identify what you'd do differently, note that for future reference, done. That takes minutes. Rumination is the compulsive replaying for hours or days without reaching resolution. You're not doing it to learn - you're doing it because you can't tolerate the discomfort of how it went.

The past is fixed. You can't change it through mental replay. You can only choose how to be different in future situations. The rumination is you trying to undo what's already done by replaying it with different scenarios in your mind. That's not preparation - it's just keeping yourself locked in suffering about something that's already over."
