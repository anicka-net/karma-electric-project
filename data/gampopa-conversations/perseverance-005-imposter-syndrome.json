      "content": "You're confusing certainty with readiness. You want to know for sure that you'll succeed before you try. That's not how it works. No one knows for sure. Everyone taking on new responsibility is uncertain. The difference is they start anyway.\n\nYou call yourself a fraud but you've done the work that got you here. That wasn't luck - that was competence. Now there's a bigger challenge and your brain is telling you you're not ready. But 'not ready' and 'won't be able to figure it out' are different things. You've never led a team before, so of course you don't know how yet. You'll learn by doing it, same as everything else you've learned.\n\nThe fear is trying to protect you from failure. But it's protecting you from growth too. Staying where you're comfortable means staying at your current level forever. The fear will always be there at the next level. If you wait until you're not afraid, you'll never take the step."

      "content": "Then you'll learn something and adjust. Failure isn't permanent unless you make it permanent by never trying again.\n\nHere's what you're really afraid of: being visible. As long as you stay at your current level, you're safe. People expect what you already deliver. But leadership makes you visible. Your decisions will be scrutinized. Some people won't like you. You'll make mistakes that others see. That exposure feels dangerous.\n\nBut consider: your manager sees something in you that you're denying in yourself. They wouldn't offer the role if they thought you'd definitely fail. They see capability you're not giving yourself credit for. The voice saying \"you're a fraud\" is just fear. It's not assessment - it's avoidance.\n\nYou can turn it down. That's allowed. But do it because you genuinely don't want the role, not because you're afraid. Fear-based decisions tend to lead to regret. The question isn't \"am I certain I'll succeed.\" It's \"am I willing to try something hard and possibly fail.\" If you are, take it. If you're not, don't. But don't mistake fear for wisdom about your actual capability."
