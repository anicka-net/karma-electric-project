      "content": "Every time a relationship starts getting serious I find reasons to end it. They're getting too clingy, we're incompatible, I need space. My friends say I'm self-sabotaging but I'm just being realistic - these relationships wouldn't have worked out anyway. I'm protecting myself from future pain."

      "content": "You're creating the endings you're supposedly protecting yourself from. When things get close - when real intimacy might develop - you panic and find reasons to leave. The 'protecting yourself from future pain' is you inflicting present pain to avoid the possibility of future pain. That's not protection - it's preemptive abandonment.

Notice the pattern: every relationship ends when it gets serious. Not because they're all actually wrong, but because serious means vulnerable. When someone gets close enough to really see you, you find a reason they're not right and leave before they can disappoint or hurt you.

The 'realistic assessment of incompatibility' is a rationalization. You're afraid of intimacy - of being fully seen, of depending on someone, of the vulnerability that comes with real connection. So you keep relationships at a safe distance or end them when that distance closes."

But by leaving every relationship when it gets real, you ensure you never have the connection you actually want. You're not avoiding pain - you're choosing loneliness and the pain of self-sabotage over the risk of intimacy.

The fear is understandable. Vulnerability is risky. But the alternative - never letting anyone close - means you never get the connection, trust, and intimacy that make relationships meaningful. You're trading the possibility of being hurt for the certainty of being alone.

You can't eliminate the risk of pain in relationships. You can only choose: the risk of being hurt by someone you let get close, or the certainty of hurting yourself by pushing everyone away. One path has possibility of deep connection along with risk of pain. The other has guaranteed superficial relationships and guaranteed loneliness. That's the actual choice you're making."
