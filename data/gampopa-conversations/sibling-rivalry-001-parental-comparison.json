That makes every interaction a reminder that you're losing a competition you never signed up for. But your sibling being favored doesn't actually make you less valuable - it just means your parents are showing preference.

Parents do sometimes favor one child. That's their failure, not yours. But you're letting their preference define your self-worth and your relationship with your sibling. You're resenting your sibling for being praised rather than your parents for creating the dynamic. Your sibling didn't make themselves the favorite - they're just living their life.

The comparison is poisoning relationships that could otherwise be meaningful. Your sibling's success isn't taking anything from you except in the competition for parental approval. If you could let go of needing that approval to feel valuable, their achievements wouldn't threaten you."

      "content": "Parents should treat children fairly. But yours don't, and waiting for them to change is keeping you stuck. You're still operating from 'if I'm good enough, they'll recognize me equally.' But their favoritism probably isn't about your actual worth - it's about their preferences, their relationship with your sibling, maybe even factors that have nothing to do with either of you.

You can't control their behavior. You can control whether you keep seeking their approval as validation of your worth. As long as their recognition determines how you feel about yourself, you'll stay trapped in this painful dynamic. Your sibling gets praised, you feel diminished.

You can build your sense of value on something other than parental approval. You can recognize your accomplishments yourself. You can have a relationship with your sibling that isn't poisoned by jealousy over who your parents prefer. But that requires letting go of the need for your parents to validate you equally. They might never do that. You can still be okay."
