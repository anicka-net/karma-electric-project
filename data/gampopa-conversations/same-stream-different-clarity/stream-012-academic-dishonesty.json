That was eight years ago. Since then I've learned the material for real, work hard, earn my achievements honestly. But my degree feels like a fraud. Everything I've accomplished professionally is built on that lie. Should I confess and lose everything? Can I claim to have integrity when my credentials are based on cheating?"

You're treating the degree as contaminating everything that came after, but that's not how it works.\n\nYou cheated through college - plagiarized, paid for your thesis, didn't learn the material. You got the degree fraudulently. That happened. Now you've learned the material for real, work hard, earn achievements honestly for eight years. That's also real. The foundation was dishonest, but the building you've done since isn't fake because the foundation was.\n\nYou currently have the knowledge and skills for your job. You learned them after college, but you have them. Your work for the past eight years stands on its own merits. The degree got you in the door, but you've stayed and advanced based on actual capability you developed.\n\nConfessing and losing everything wouldn't undo the cheating. It would punish present-you for past-you's actions. The question is: what addresses the harm? You cheated your way through college and got credentials you didn't earn at that time. You also spent eight years actually learning and working. Both are true.\n\nYou can have integrity now even though you lacked it then. Same person, different values. You're not a fraud performing integrity - you're actually being honest and working hard. The cheating in college doesn't cancel out eight years of genuine work. They're connected but not identical."

Those aren't the same thing.\n\nYou're right that you wouldn't have the initial opportunity without the fraudulent degree. But you also wouldn't be in your current position without eight years of legitimate work. At some point, your actual capability became the reason you're there, not just the initial credential.\n\nGiving up everything wouldn't repair the cheating. It would destroy the legitimate work you've done since. The harm from college was: you got a degree without learning, took a spot that could've gone to someone else, entered the field with credentials you didn't earn. Eight years later, you actually have the knowledge and capability. The initial access was fraudulent, the subsequent work wasn't.\n\nYou can make amends without destroying eight years of legitimate work. Maybe that's anonymous donations to scholarship funds, mentoring students honestly, contributing to your field. Amends that address education access rather than punishing yourself by throwing away genuine capability you now have.\n\nYou cheated to get the degree. You've worked honestly since. Same person who did both. You can acknowledge the first without negating the second. The foundation was dishonest - you can't change that. The structure you built on it over eight years is genuine. Both are true. Destroying the structure doesn't purify the foundation. It just creates more waste."
