But I look at my scars every day and wonder if I'm actually better or just between episodes. My therapist says I've made real progress but I feel like I'm always going to be 'a cutter' even if I'm not currently cutting. How can I trust that I've changed when those scars are permanent proof of who I was?"

They're not proof that you're still that person or that you'll return to it.\n\nFour years without self-harm, therapy, developed coping skills - that's real change. You're not between episodes. You're someone who used to self-harm and doesn't now. The worry that you're \"always going to be a cutter\" treats self-harm as your essential identity rather than a behavior you engaged in under certain conditions.\n\nYou harmed yourself for years when you were suffering and didn't know other ways to cope. Now you have other ways and you use them. Same person, different capacity. The scars connect you to that past - they're there, they're real. But they don't determine your present or future. They're evidence of pain you survived, not evidence that you're destined to return to it.\n\nYour therapist is right about real progress. But you don't trust it because you're treating the scars as more real than four years of different behavior. The past is permanent in the sense that it happened. The scars show that. But the person who made those scars and the person who hasn't made new ones for four years - those are the same person at different points with different tools."

They don't prove you'll automatically return to it if stressed.\n\nYou're worried about losing control under extreme stress. That's understandable - you know what you did when you were overwhelmed before. But you also have four years of evidence that you handle stress differently now. You've probably been stressed in those four years and didn't cut. That's data about your current patterns, not just luck.\n\nMost people are capable of harmful behaviors under extreme conditions. You know yours specifically. But knowing your vulnerability isn't the same as being guaranteed to repeat it. You developed other coping skills for a reason - they work. They've worked for four years.\n\nThe scars aren't a prediction. They're a record. Record of pain you were in, record of how you coped when you didn't have better options. Now you have better options and you use them. That's not fragile recovery waiting to collapse - it's actual development.\n\nYou're not \"a cutter who's currently not cutting.\" You're someone who self-harmed when you had certain levels of pain and certain lack of tools, and who now has different tools and uses them. The continuity is real - same person. The change is also real - different capacity. Both are true. The scars remind you of the first. Four years of not cutting demonstrates the second."
