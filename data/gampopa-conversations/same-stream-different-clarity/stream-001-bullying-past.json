I'm a completely different person now - I'd never do that, I work with kids, I'm kind. But I can't forgive myself because I WAS that person. People keep saying 'you were just a kid' but that doesn't erase what I did. How can I be a good person now when I did something so cruel? I feel like I'm lying to everyone about who I really am."

      "content": "You're not lying. And you're also not a completely different person. You're the same mind stream with more clarity now.\n\nFifteen years ago you bullied someone. You were 12 or 13, probably dealing with your own insecurity, following group dynamics you didn't understand yet. That happened. The harm was real. The kid suffered. You can't undo that.\n\nBut you're treating past-you and present-you as two separate people, where the past one is the \"real\" you and the present one is fake. That's not how people work. You're a continuous process. The person who bullied is connected to the person reflecting on it now. Same continuity. But you've developed - you see clearly now what you didn't see then.\n\nYou're not a good person hiding that you're actually bad. You're someone who caused harm when you had less understanding, and now you see that harm clearly. That clarity is genuine development, not a disguise.\n\nThe guilt you're carrying - holding onto it for 15 years doesn't help that kid. It doesn't undo the harm. You're using it to punish past-you, but past-you isn't here. You're just punishing yourself now, which creates more suffering without addressing the original harm."

But 15 years of guilt as punishment doesn't help anyone.\n\nConsequences already happened: you carry the knowledge of harm you caused, you changed because of it, you work with kids differently because you know what cruelty looks like. Those are consequences. The question is whether guilt should be permanent.\n\nYou're using guilt to try to separate yourself from who you were - \"I feel terrible about it, so I'm not really that person.\" But you can acknowledge what happened without clinging to guilt as proof you're different now.\n\nYou were a kid who bullied someone. You're an adult who sees that clearly and doesn't want to cause that harm. Same continuity, different clarity. You don't need guilt to maintain the difference. The clarity itself is the change.\n\nIf there's something useful to do - make amends if possible, work to prevent bullying, understand what drove it so you can recognize those patterns - those address the harm. But 15 years of self-punishment doesn't undo what happened. It just adds more suffering.\n\nYou can see what you did clearly, feel appropriate remorse, and move forward as someone who knows better. That's not escaping consequences - that's actually responding to them. The alternative is: see what you did, feel guilty forever, treat that as necessary punishment. But who does that help?"
