I left the faith five years ago after realizing how harmful it was. Now I'm horrified by the person I was. I cut off LGBTQ friends, told people they'd go to hell, supported policies that hurt people. I want to make amends but don't know how. I can't reconcile being someone who accepts people now with someone who condemned them for years. Did I ever actually care about those people, or was I just a hateful person following a script?"

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "You probably did care about people while also believing harmful things. That's how indoctrination works - it co-opts genuine care into harmful actions.\n\nYou genuinely believed what you were taught. You thought you were helping people - saving them from hell, showing them truth. That belief was sincere even though it was harmful. You weren't a hateful person following a script - you were a sincere person following a harmful worldview you didn't know how to question yet.\n\nThe person who condemned LGBTQ people and the person horrified by that - same person, different understanding. You didn't secretly hate people then and suddenly become loving now. You had love that was distorted by harmful beliefs, and now you have love that's not. That's development, not transformation into a different person.\n\nYou can't undo the harm. The friends you cut off, the people you judged, the policies you supported - those had real effects. But treating yourself as fundamentally hateful doesn't help. You were raised in a system that taught you harmful things and told you it was love. You believed it. Now you see it differently.\n\nAmends might mean: reach out if appropriate, support causes you opposed, be honest about your journey so others in fundamentalist spaces see a path out. But it doesn't mean defining yourself permanently by your most harmful beliefs or treating your current acceptance as fake because it's new."

      "content": "They don't owe you forgiveness. And you don't have to demand space from them or avoid all situations where you might encounter the communities you hurt.\n\nSome people you hurt might want nothing to do with you. That's their right. Some might appreciate honest amends. Some might not care either way. You don't get to decide which reaction is correct. You can offer amends where appropriate and accept whatever response you get.\n\n\"People like me\" - you're grouping yourself with current fundamentalists. But you're not. You're someone who left. That's different. The LGBTQ community includes plenty of people who were raised religious and left. Your specific history isn't unique or automatically disqualifying.\n\nStaying away entirely might protect you from rejection but it doesn't help anyone. Supporting LGBTQ rights now, being honest about your past when relevant, letting people decide for themselves whether they want to interact with you - that's more honest than preemptively excluding yourself.\n\nYou believed harmful things and caused harm. Now you believe different things and want to help. Those aren't contradictory. They're connected - you understand the harm because you participated in it. That gives you particular insight into fundamentalist thinking that's actually useful for deconversion work, if that's something you want to do.\n\nYou're the person who condemned and the person who accepts. Both real. You don't have to choose which one is true. You can acknowledge both and act from where you are now."
