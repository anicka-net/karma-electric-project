I've been to therapy, done anger management, haven't been in a fight since. I volunteer with at-risk youth now. But sometimes I remember that night and think - I'm capable of seriously hurting someone. What if I'm still that person but just haven't been triggered the right way? Can someone who beat someone that badly ever really be trusted to be non-violent?"

The question is whether those conditions control you the way they did then.\n\nTwelve years ago you assaulted someone badly. You were drinking, got into a fight, didn't stop when you should have. You caused serious harm. You faced consequences - did time, went to therapy, worked on anger management. That was all confronting what you did and why.\n\nNow you haven't been violent for twelve years and you work with at-risk youth. That's not hiding who you are - that's being someone who knows what violence looks like from the inside and chooses differently. The worry \"what if I just haven't been triggered\" is you not trusting the work you've done.\n\nYou're not a non-violent person hiding that you're actually violent. You're someone who was violent once under certain conditions and has spent twelve years developing different responses. The capacity for violence exists - it exists in most people. The difference is: you know yours, you've worked with it, you've built different patterns.\n\nVolunteering with at-risk youth - you can do that because you know what anger and violence look like from inside, not despite it. You're not separate from who you were. You're continuous with them - same person who now sees more clearly and responds differently."

      "content": "You were dangerous that night. You're not now, as proven by twelve years of not being violent.\n\nYou could have killed someone - that's true. You caused serious harm. But you're treating that as revealing something permanent about you: \"I'm fundamentally dangerous.\" That's not how people work. You were dangerous under those specific conditions - drunk, in a fight, not able to stop. Now you're not in those conditions and you've built capacity to handle anger differently.\n\nShould you be trusted around vulnerable people? That's determined by your actual behavior over time, not by your worst moment. Twelve years, therapy, anger management, working with youth - those are the evidence. If you were still violent or had poor impulse control, that would show up. It hasn't.\n\nYour concern about being fundamentally dangerous - that's actually evidence of non-violence. Someone who's actually dangerous isn't worried about it. You're worried because you know what you're capable of at your worst and you don't want to be that again. That awareness is what keeps you careful, what makes you good at youth work. You know what anger that gets out of control looks like.\n\nYou beat someone badly twelve years ago. You're not that person anymore in the sense that you don't have the same patterns, same responses, same lack of control. But you're also not completely different - you remember it, you use that knowledge. Same stream, different clarity. The awareness of your capacity for violence informed how you developed non-violence. They're connected, not separate."
