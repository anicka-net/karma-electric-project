I've completely changed - I'm embarrassed by everything I believed. I work in community organizing now, actively fight against that ideology. But I see screenshots of my old posts sometimes and I'm horrified. That was me. I said those things. How do I reconcile being someone who fights racism now with being someone who said racist things five years ago? Do I deserve to be in this work?"

      "content": "You deserve to be in the work if you're genuinely doing it, which you are. Your past doesn't disqualify you - it informs your understanding of how that radicalization works.\n\nFive years ago you held harmful views and said awful things. The harm was real - people were hurt by that rhetoric, you contributed to a dangerous movement. Now you see that clearly and work against it. Same person, different understanding. The college version of you believed something you now recognize as deeply wrong.\n\nYou're horrified seeing old posts - that horror means you've actually changed, not that you're pretending. If you still believed those things and were faking progressive views, you wouldn't be horrified. You'd be calculating. The genuine shame you feel is your current self recognizing the harm your past self caused.\n\nBut you're treating past-you as the \"real\" you and present-you as suspicious. \"How do I deserve to be in this work?\" Because you're doing it. You're not a former racist hiding among activists. You're someone who was radicalized, got out, and now works against radicalization. That's more useful than someone who was never susceptible to it and can't understand how people get pulled in.\n\nYou can fight racism now and acknowledge you said racist things before. Those aren't contradictory. They're connected - you know what needs fighting because you know what it looked like from the inside."

      "content": "People who were hurt absolutely have a right to not trust you immediately. Trust is earned through consistent action over time, which is what you're doing.\n\nStepping back entirely isn't necessarily what serves the work. You have insight into radicalization that others don't. You know what arguments pulled you in, what made you leave, how that community operates. That's valuable for deradicalization work specifically. Not every anti-racist role requires someone with your background, but some do.\n\nYou're asking \"shouldn't I just let people who were never racist do this?\" But that treats anti-racism as only for the pure. It's not. It's for anyone working to reduce that harm. Someone who was never radicalized might not understand what you understand. Someone who was always clear about racism might not be able to reach people you can reach.\n\nYou should be honest about your past when relevant, accept that some people won't trust you, and let your actions over time speak. Five years of genuine work matters. Not everyone will believe the change is real - that's fair. But hiding your past or stepping away entirely doesn't serve the people who could benefit from your specific understanding.\n\nYou were radicalized, you caused harm, you got out, you work against it now. That's a coherent arc. It doesn't erase the harm, but it's honest about all of it. That honesty is more useful than either hiding the past or disqualifying yourself forever because of it."
