I don't drink anymore, haven't driven after even one beer since, completely changed my relationship with alcohol. But I still feel like a monster. I could have killed a family. The fact that I didn't is just luck, not because I'm actually a good person. How do I live with knowing I'm capable of that level of recklessness?"

      "content": "You're right that nobody dying was luck. You're wrong that this means you're not actually changed.\n\nYou drove drunk and hit another car. You could have killed someone - that's true. The harm potential was enormous even though the actual harm was limited. That was seven years ago. You stopped drinking, don't drive after any alcohol, changed your relationship with it completely. That's genuine change, not performance.\n\nYou're treating the potential worst outcome (killing someone) as more real than the actual sustained change (seven years of different behavior). \"The fact that I didn't is just luck\" - yes. But the fact that you haven't driven drunk for seven years isn't luck. That's choice, repeated over time.\n\nYou were reckless once in a way that could have killed someone. You're not reckless that way now. Same person, different relationship to alcohol and responsibility. You're not a monster hiding among good people. You're someone who did something dangerous, got lucky that it wasn't worse, and changed because of it.\n\nLiving with it means: acknowledge you could have killed someone, remember that whenever you're tempted to minimize risk, use that awareness to stay careful. Not: define yourself permanently by worst potential outcome that luckily didn't happen. The recklessness was real. The seven years of care are also real."

      "content": "There were consequences - DUI, probably legal penalties, the knowledge of what you almost did. You're also living with seven years of changed behavior. That's not \"getting away with it.\"\n\nYou want cosmic punishment proportional to worst potential outcome. But that's not how consequence works. You harmed someone (the accident), you could have harmed them much worse (killing them), you faced legal consequences, you changed your behavior. Those are the actual consequences.\n\n\"Owing something to the universe\" - you can live more carefully, don't drive recklessly, maybe support organizations that address drunk driving, help others who struggle with alcohol. Those address the harm in practical ways. Permanent self-condemnation doesn't pay a debt. It just adds more suffering without helping anyone.\n\nYou got lucky that you didn't kill anyone. That luck is why you still have a life to live differently. You can use that life carefully and well, or you can waste it in permanent guilt about what could have happened. The people in the car you hit benefit more from you being someone who never drives drunk again than from you suffering forever.\n\nYou were reckless and lucky. Now you're careful. Those aren't contradictory. You're someone who almost caused catastrophic harm, got lucky, and genuinely changed. All of that is true. The change doesn't erase the recklessness, but the recklessness doesn't negate seven years of being different."
