I've been in therapy for years, apologized to them as adults, tried to repair. They're gracious about it but I see how it affected them. I'm a totally different person now - patient, understanding, working on myself. But I can't forgive myself for those years. I destroyed parts of their childhood. How can I be the person who did that AND the person who wants to help them heal from what I did?"

      "content": "You're the same person at different points. The parent who yelled and the parent trying to repair - those aren't separate people. You with untreated depression causing harm, and you in therapy trying to address it. Same continuity, more clarity now.\n\nYou did cause harm. Your kids' childhoods were affected by your emotional abuse. That's real. You were suffering yourself - undiagnosed depression - but that's an explanation, not an excuse. You harmed them.\n\nNow you see that clearly, you've apologized, you're in therapy, you're different with them. That's also real. You're not pretending to be a good parent while secretly being the abusive one. You were abusive. Now you're not. The person who caused the harm is the same person trying to repair it. That's how repair actually works - it's done by the person who caused the harm, after they gain more clarity.\n\nYour kids are gracious - they see you trying. They probably see both who you were and who you are now. They're not choosing between \"real parent\" and \"fake parent.\" They're relating to someone who hurt them and is now genuinely different. That's complex, but it's honest.\n\nYou can't undo those years. You can't give them a different childhood. But you also can't spend forever punishing yourself as payment. They need you present now, not consumed with guilt about then. That doesn't mean forgetting - it means seeing clearly and living differently."

      "content": "You owe them honesty, repair where possible, and changed behavior. Permanent guilt doesn't help them.\n\nThey do live with consequences. Their anxiety and relationship issues are partly from how you treated them. You can't fix that retroactively. But wallowing in guilt doesn't help them heal - it might actually burden them with your suffering on top of their own.\n\nYou're using guilt as if it's payment for what you did. But they don't benefit from you suffering forever. They benefit from you being stable enough now to acknowledge what happened, support their healing, and not repeat those patterns if they have kids.\n\nYou apologized. You're in therapy. You're different with them now. Those are the things that matter. The self-punishment on top of that - that's for you, not for them. It might make you feel like you're taking responsibility, but actually taking responsibility means: see what you did, understand how it happened, don't do it again, be available to help them heal now.\n\nThey're gracious. They're relating to you. If you're consumed with guilt, you're not fully present for that relationship. You're still making it about your suffering over what you did, rather than their healing from what you did.\n\nYou were an abusive parent. You're not now. Those are both true. You can hold both without disappearing into permanent guilt. They need the current you, clear-eyed about the past but able to be present in the relationship they're offering you now."
