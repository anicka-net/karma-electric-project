I've gotten my life together, been in therapy, want to reconnect. She's willing to meet but I'm paralyzed with shame. I abandoned my child. What kind of person does that? I have other kids now who I'm a good parent to. How can I face her knowing I was capable of abandoning her but stayed for my other children? Do I even deserve a relationship with her?"

      "content": "You don't have to deserve it for her to choose to offer it. She's willing to meet - that's her decision about what she wants, not about what you've earned.\n\nYou abandoned a two-year-old when you were young and overwhelmed. That caused profound harm - she grew up without a parent, has had to live with that abandonment. The harm is real and permanent in its effects. Now you're a different parent to other children, want to reconnect, have been in therapy. That's also real.\n\nYou can be both the person who left and the person trying to repair. Not separate people - continuous. You abandoned her under certain conditions when you were younger and less capable. You stayed for your other children under different conditions when you'd developed more capacity. The difference in behavior reflects your development, not that one is real and one is fake.\n\nFacing her means acknowledging what you did without hiding behind shame. She needs to see that you understand you abandoned her, that the harm was real, and that you're not going to minimize it or make it about your suffering. Your shame is understandable, but if it paralyzes you, you're making the meeting about managing your guilt rather than about her.\n\nShe's offering a chance. You don't control whether you \"deserve\" it. You can show up honestly, acknowledge the harm, let her express whatever she needs to, and see if something can be built. That's all you can do."

      "content": "She can't trust you based on your past - you're right about that. She can only trust you based on what you do now, over time, if she chooses to build a relationship.\n\nYou left when she was two because you couldn't handle parenting. You didn't leave your other children - you handled parenting them. That's different capacity at different times. It doesn't erase that you left her, but it shows you're not someone who automatically abandons when stressed. You're someone who did that once and hasn't done it since.\n\nShe doesn't have to trust you. Trust would be earned slowly if she even wants to try. Maybe she wants to meet out of curiosity, or to tell you how she feels, or to get medical history - not necessarily to have a relationship. You can't arrive expecting trust or a relationship. You can only arrive with honest acknowledgment of what you did and openness to whatever she needs.\n\nYou proved you'll leave under certain circumstances. You also proved you can stay under others. Both are true. She gets to decide what that means for her and whether any relationship is possible. Your job isn't to convince her you're trustworthy - it's to be honest about what happened and let her make her own choices.\n\nYou're the parent who left and the parent who stayed for other kids. That's hard to reconcile. But you don't resolve it by deciding which one is \"real.\" You acknowledge both and let her respond to that truth however she needs to."
