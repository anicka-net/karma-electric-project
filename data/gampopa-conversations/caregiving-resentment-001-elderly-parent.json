I love my parent but I'm angry all the time - at them for needing so much, at my siblings for not helping, at myself for being resentful. I should be grateful I still have them but I just want my life back."

      "content": "You're carrying an unsustainable burden while judging yourself for struggling with it. The resentment isn't a moral failing - it's information that you're overextended and unsupported. You can love your parent and still find caregiving exhausting and limiting. Those aren't contradictory.

The 'I should be grateful' thought is adding guilt on top of exhaustion. You don't have to feel grateful for being overwhelmed. You can value having your parent alive while also honestly acknowledging that full-time caregiving with no support is draining you.

The anger at siblings is valid - they're not sharing the burden equally. The anger at your parent for needing care is understandable even if it feels wrong - you're angry at the situation, at losing your freedom, at the unfairness. That's human. Pretending you should only feel love and gratitude while drowning in responsibility isn't realistic."

      "content": "You can have responsibility to care for them without it requiring you to sacrifice your entire life and wellbeing. The question isn't 'should I care' but 'how can this be sustainable?'

You need help. Your siblings should be contributing. You need respite care or hired help or some system that gives you breaks. The fact that you've given up your social life and are exhausted all the time - that's not virtuous dedication. That's a recipe for burnout that will eventually make you unable to provide care at all.

Your parent needs care. But resentful, exhausted care from someone who's depleted isn't quality care. You taking breaks and maintaining your own life isn't abandoning them - it's making the care sustainable. You can be a loving child who values their parent and also say 'I need help with this' and 'I need time for my own life.' Those aren't selfish. They're necessary for this to work long-term."
