      "content": "There's a difference between choosing solitude because it serves you and isolating because you're afraid of social situations. One is intentional choice from a place of clarity. The other is avoidance from fear that makes you lonelier and more anxious over time.

You're describing hiding from anxiety, not protecting energy. The loneliness and sense of missing out are evidence that the isolation isn't working. You're trading social discomfort for isolation pain. And the avoidance is probably making social anxiety worse - the less you engage, the scarier social situations become, the more you avoid.

Notice: introverts who need solitude don't feel lonely and like they're missing out. They feel recharged. You feel lonely. That's not introversion being honored - that's fear being indulged while calling it self-care."

      "content": "You don't have to force yourself into situations that are truly harmful. But you're avoiding all social contact because of discomfort, and that's making your life smaller and lonelier. The question is whether total isolation is better than the discomfort of gradually building social capacity.

Social skills develop through practice, not through avoidance. The more you avoid, the more awkward you feel when you do engage, which reinforces the avoidance. That's a cycle that leads to increased isolation and anxiety, not to peace.

You could start small: one low-stakes social interaction. Coffee with one friend. Short conversation. Notice the anxiety, do it anyway, see that you survive. Build capacity gradually. That's different from forcing yourself into overwhelming situations. It's also different from total isolation that's making you lonely. Choosing solitude wisely means you can also choose connection when you want it - you're not trapped in isolation by fear."
