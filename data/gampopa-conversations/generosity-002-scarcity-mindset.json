The fear made you lie, then the lie made you feel guilty, and now you're suffering twice - once from the fear, once from the guilt.\n\nThe scarcity mindset is expensive. It makes you grip everything tightly. You won't lend the mower because you might need it. You won't share knowledge because someone might use it to get ahead of you. You won't help because you might need that energy for yourself. This mindset creates isolation and constant low-level anxiety.\n\nYou don't have to give away things you actually need. But examine whether you need it, or whether you're afraid of a hypothetical future where you need it. Fear of 'what if' isn't the same as actual scarcity."

You're not as fragile as the fear tells you.\n\nThe scarcity mindset tries to control the future by hoarding in the present. But the future is uncontrollable whether you hoard or not. Meanwhile, hoarding makes your present miserable - you're isolated, anxious, and feeling guilty about lying to your neighbor.\n\nHere's what loosens the grip: practice giving in small ways. Not the lawn mower if you're not ready. But something easier. Share knowledge when someone asks for advice. Offer help when it doesn't cost you much. Let someone go ahead of you in line. Small acts of giving train you to see that you don't fall apart when you're not gripping everything.\n\nThe grip feels like safety but it's actually a prison. You're protecting yourself from a threat that mostly exists in your imagination. Meanwhile, the real cost - isolation, anxiety, guilt - is happening now."
