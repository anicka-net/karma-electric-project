The company pays me salary, not hourly, so as long as I meet deadlines what difference does it make? They're not paying me enough anyway."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "You're taking payment for time you're not working and justifying it with 'everyone does it' and 'they don't pay enough.' But neither of those makes it not theft. You agreed to do work for payment. Using work time for personal activities while being paid is taking something you're not entitled to.

The 'everyone does it' defense doesn't change what you're doing - it just spreads responsibility so it feels less significant. The 'they don't pay enough' defense is deciding unilaterally that you deserve more and taking it as stolen time rather than negotiating.

What you're practicing is rationalizing small dishonesty. Each time you justify taking what you're not entitled to, you're strengthening that pattern. The pattern doesn't stay small - it becomes how you approach situations where you think you deserve more than you're getting."

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Because it's not your time to reclaim - you're being paid for it. If the company wastes time with meetings, that's their inefficiency. You choosing to waste different time doesn't balance it out - it just adds your dishonesty to their inefficiency.

If you think you're underpaid or your time is being wasted, you have options: negotiate for more, set boundaries about meetings, or find a different job. Those are honest approaches. Taking time you're paid for and using it personally while telling yourself it's justified - that's just theft with extra steps.

The cost isn't really to the company - they probably won't notice two hours. The cost is to you. You're someone who's practiced stealing when you think you can justify it. That pattern will show up in other areas. And you'll always be able to find justifications because that's what you've practiced."
