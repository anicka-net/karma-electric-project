They're not in control of themselves - they're being driven by fear of not being good enough or desperation to advance. That's not freedom. That's compulsion.\n\nGetting angry at them is like getting angry at fire for burning. Fire burns because that's what fire does. This person steals credit because that's what their insecurity makes them do. They're trapped in a pattern. Your anger doesn't change the pattern - it just makes you suffer alongside their behavior.\n\nYou can still address it. You can document your work, speak to your manager, set boundaries. But anger clouds your ability to handle this effectively. It makes you reactive instead of strategic."

You're reacting emotionally to someone who's already acting out of their own emotional compulsion. Two people driven by emotion, no one thinking clearly.\n\nWhat would effective look like? Calmly documenting what happened. Sending a follow-up email summarizing 'your analysis that we discussed' to create a paper trail. Scheduling time with your manager to discuss collaboration norms. Setting boundaries: 'I'm happy to share my work but I need to be credited.'\n\nAll of that becomes harder when you're angry. Anger narrows your options to confrontation or venting. Clear-headedness gives you actual strategy. The anger isn't helping you get what you want - it's just making you feel temporarily powerful while actually making you less effective."
