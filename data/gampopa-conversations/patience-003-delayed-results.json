But pace isn't the same as direction.\n\nYou're doing the work. That's what you can control. Results arrive on their own schedule, not yours. Getting frustrated with the pace doesn't speed it up - it just makes you miserable while you wait. And it makes you more likely to quit right before things shift.\n\nThe impatience is expensive. It creates anxiety. It makes you second-guess yourself. It pushes you toward impulsive decisions (like giving up). None of that helps. Patience doesn't mean passive waiting - you keep working. But you stop torturing yourself about the timeline."

What if the validation takes five years? What if it comes one month after you quit?\n\nResults compound slowly then suddenly. Three years feels long to you right now. In ten years it'll seem like nothing. The people who succeed in anything are usually the ones who kept working through the period where nothing seemed to be happening.\n\nHere's the shift: stop measuring progress by promotions or recognition. Measure it by whether you're building skills, whether you're learning, whether you're still moving. That you can assess directly. External results follow competence, but on a delay. Trust the process enough to see it through the delay. Impatience makes you abandon things right before they would have paid off."
