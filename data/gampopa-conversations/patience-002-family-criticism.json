She says something about your apartment - you could hear \"apartment comment\" or you could hear \"I'm not good enough.\" The second interpretation is your addition. That's where your suffering is coming from.\n\nThe situation is already unpleasant. Your anger about it being unpleasant is adding a second layer of suffering on top. She criticizes (unpleasant), then you ruminate about how she shouldn't be like this (suffering you're creating)."

You can spend energy arguing with reality about how she should be different, or you can work with the reality that she's critical.\n\nWorking with reality looks like: accepting that she will probably criticize, so you're not surprised or devastated each time. Setting boundaries about what you'll discuss. Ending conversations when they become lectures. Not seeking her validation because you know it's not reliably available.\n\nThis isn't about excusing her behavior. It's about stopping your own suffering. Every time you think \"why does she have to be like this\" you're arguing with what is. That argument never wins. She is like this. That's the starting point. What you do from there is up to you - but rage about why she exists this way just keeps you stuck in suffering."
