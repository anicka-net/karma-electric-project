Each purchase feels good briefly - the new phone is exciting for a few days - then baseline resets and you're looking for the next hit.\n\nThat's not failure. That's how material satisfaction works. It's designed to be temporary. The manufacturers know this. The economy depends on it. You're experiencing what everyone experiences: objects can't fill the gap you're trying to fill.\n\nThe cycle breaks when you stop believing the next thing will be different. The new phone won't satisfy you any more than the last one did. Not because there's something wrong with you, but because satisfaction from acquisition is inherently temporary."

The car gets you places or it doesn't. When you buy something, be clear: \"This serves a function\" or \"I want this for enjoyment\" - not \"This will finally make me feel complete.\"\n\nThe exhaustion comes from the constant seeking, from believing satisfaction is just one purchase away. When you accept that nothing you buy will fill that gap permanently, you stop chasing. You might still buy things, but you're not expecting them to solve the restlessness.\n\nWhat you're feeling isn't a purchasing problem. It's a dissatisfaction you're trying to solve by acquiring things. That approach can't work. The dissatisfaction is the baseline human condition. Things just distract from it temporarily."
