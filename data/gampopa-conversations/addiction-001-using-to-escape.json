But lately I need more to get the same effect, and I feel terrible in the mornings. My partner says I'm drinking too much but without it I just feel anxious and can't relax. I don't think I have a problem - I'm just managing stress."

      "content": "You're using alcohol to avoid feeling stress and anxiety rather than addressing them. That works temporarily - the drinking does provide relief. But the stress and anxiety don't go away. They accumulate while you're numbed out, then return with the added burden of physical effects from drinking and the need for more to achieve the same escape.

The pattern: feel anxious, drink to numb it, brief relief, feel terrible, increased anxiety, need more alcohol for same relief. You're not managing stress - you're adding a dependence cycle on top of the original stress. The problems you're avoiding through drinking aren't being resolved. They're still there, plus now you have a drinking pattern that's causing its own problems.

Notice: you can't relax without alcohol anymore. That's dependence. Your body has adapted so that normal relaxation mechanisms don't work. You need the substance just to feel neutral, not even good."

      "content": "There's a difference between occasionally having a drink and needing alcohol daily to be able to relax. The fact that you can't unwind without it means it's no longer helping you relax - it's preventing you from being able to relax naturally.

You can deal with stress by actually addressing it: examining what's causing the work stress and what can change, working on relationship problems directly instead of numbing yourself to them, developing practices that reduce anxiety without substances - exercise, talking to people, therapy, meditation, whatever works for you.

Those approaches are harder and less immediately effective than drinking. But they don't create a dependence cycle that compounds your problems. Right now you're using alcohol to avoid the discomfort of anxiety, which prevents you from addressing what's making you anxious, which increases anxiety, which requires more alcohol. That's not stress management - it's a trap that gets tighter the longer you're in it."
