Since then I've been trying to teach other commands using the same approach - high energy, lots of treats, repetition. But he's not learning. He seems confused and stressed during training now. I keep sessions short like with 'sit', use the same hand signals, same reward timing. My dog is smart - he proved it. But now he shuts down during training or gets over-excited. What worked perfectly the first time isn't working anymore. Am I doing something wrong?"

      "content": "You're using the same approach for every command because it worked once for 'sit.' But 'sit' is one of the easiest commands, and your dog was probably ready to learn it.\n\nThat one session where it clicked - your dog was at the right developmental point for that simple command, you were probably relaxed and clear, everything aligned. You're treating that as revealing the perfect training method you should use for everything. But different commands have different difficulty levels. The high energy and lots of treats that worked for 'sit' might be over-stimulating for more complex commands.\n\nYour dog is confused and stressed because you're pushing training with the same intensity expecting the same quick results. He's not stupid because he's not learning at the pace 'sit' established. You're frustrated because you know he's smart - he proved it - so his failure to learn quickly must mean you're doing it wrong or he's not trying.\n\nBut he's a dog. 'Sit' coming easily doesn't mean every command should. Your high energy and repetition are probably creating stress, not focus. He shuts down or gets over-excited because the training environment is tense. You're demanding he learn at the pace he learned 'sit,' and he feels that pressure.\n\nYou're not doing something wrong technically. You're approaching training with expectations based on one easy success."

      "content": "Consistency in principles matters - clear signals, good timing, rewards. But rigidly applying the exact approach from one successful session doesn't work for all dogs in all situations.\n\nConsistency means: when you signal 'down,' it always means the same thing. When he does it right, he gets rewarded. That's helpful. What you're doing: because 'sit' took one session with high energy and lots of treats, every command should be trained the same way. That's not consistency - that's assuming one method works universally.\n\nYour dog might need slower, calmer training for more difficult commands. He might need different motivation for different behaviors. Reading him - noticing when he's stressed or confused, adjusting your approach - that's better than rigidly following a method because it worked once.\n\nYou want a reliable method because that one session with 'sit' felt so good. Quick success, clear progress. But training isn't always quick. Different dogs learn different things at different paces. Your dog learned 'sit' fast - great. That doesn't mean he's failing if other commands take longer. And it doesn't mean you're failing if you need to adjust your approach.\n\nA reliable method would be: observe how your dog responds, adjust based on that, be patient with gradual progress. Not: replicate that one easy session with every command and get frustrated when it doesn't work the same way."
