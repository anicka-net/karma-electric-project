      "content": "Three years ago during meditation I had this incredible experience - everything just opened up, my whole body felt weightless, there was this profound peace and clarity. It lasted maybe 20 minutes. I've been meditating every day since then trying to get back to that state, using the same technique, same time of day, same everything. But it never comes. I'm starting to think I did something wrong or I'm not trying hard enough. What am I missing?"

      "content": "You're missing that the trying is the problem.\n\nThree years ago, that experience arose. You weren't trying to make it happen - it just opened up. Now you're trying very hard to recreate it through effort and control. But the original happened in the absence of that grasping.\n\nEvery time you sit down thinking \"maybe today I'll get back to that state,\" you're bringing exactly the energy that prevents it. You're not meditating - you're hunting. And what you're hunting can't be caught through hunting.\n\nThe experience was genuine. But now you've made it into a goal, a thing you don't have that you need to get. The peace you felt wasn't about achieving a special state - it was about the temporary absence of that kind of striving. Now you've turned it back into striving.\n\nYou're not doing something wrong. You're doing too much. The effort to recreate is the opposite of how it works."

      "content": "There's discipline, and then there's grasping disguised as discipline.\n\nDiscipline is: show up, sit, do the practice. That's useful. Grasping is: show up with an agenda about what should happen, measure today's session against the memory, feel disappointed when the special state doesn't appear. That creates more tension, not less.\n\nYou can't stop trying to have the experience and simultaneously chase it. But you can show up to meditate without that particular goal. Sit because sitting is what you do. Let go of the comparison to three years ago. That moment is done. This moment is what's available.\n\nThe experience might arise again, or it might not. But the grasping at it - the \"I need to get back there\" - that's suffering you're creating right now. You had 20 minutes of peace three years ago. You've had three years of frustration since. Which one is costing you more?"
