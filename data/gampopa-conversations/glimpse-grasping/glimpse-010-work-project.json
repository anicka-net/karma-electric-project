      "content": "Two years ago I led a project at work where everything just clicked. The team worked great together, problems got solved quickly, my presentations were effortless. It was the best professional experience I've ever had. Since then I've led four more projects and they've all been struggles - team conflicts, delays, I'm second-guessing every decision. I keep trying to figure out what made that first project special. I've analyzed it endlessly - was it the team composition? My approach? The problem space? I try to replicate those conditions but nothing works. Now my confidence is shot because I know I'm capable of that level of performance but can't access it. What was different about that project?"

      "content": "What was different: you weren't carrying around a comparison to a previous perfect project while you worked.\n\nThat first project, things clicked. Great. But you're treating it as revealing your \"true\" capability, and everything since as failing to reach your actual level. Now every project you lead, you're simultaneously trying to manage the work AND measuring yourself against two years ago. Of course your confidence is shot - you're constantly comparing yourself to a memory and finding the present version inadequate.\n\nYou've analyzed that project endlessly trying to extract a formula. But projects aren't recipes. Different team, different problem, different context. Trying to replicate conditions ignores that the single biggest condition has changed: the first time, you weren't trying to recreate a past success. You were just working.\n\nYour team probably feels the comparison too. You're not actually leading them - you're trying to make them into the team that worked perfectly two years ago. Every problem that arises, you're treating as evidence this isn't the magic project. So conflicts don't get addressed honestly, they get treated as deviations from how things should be going.\n\nYou're second-guessing every decision because you're using that old project as the standard. Does this decision match what worked before? You're not evaluating what this project needs. You're trying to pass a test you've created."

      "content": "Learning from success is useful. Treating one successful project as the template you must recreate is different.\n\nYou can learn things: that team worked well, maybe because you gave them autonomy. That's useful information. But you've gone beyond learning - you're trying to reverse-engineer magic. You've analyzed it \"endlessly,\" trying to figure out what made it special. That's not learning, that's grasping.\n\nThe first project probably went well because you were engaged with the actual challenges, making decisions based on what was needed. You weren't performing a technique or following a formula. Now you're trying to apply the formula you extracted from success. But \"what worked\" wasn't a formula - it was responding to that specific situation.\n\nYour last four projects might genuinely have had harder problems, worse team fits, whatever. Or they might have been fine but you're experiencing them through the filter of \"this isn't as effortless as that time.\" You can't tell which, because you're not actually present to these projects. You're comparing them to a standard.\n\nYou want to \"access\" that level of performance again. But performance isn't a state you access - it's what happens when you're fully engaged with the work. You can't be fully engaged while simultaneously monitoring whether this matches your peak experience. That's split attention."
