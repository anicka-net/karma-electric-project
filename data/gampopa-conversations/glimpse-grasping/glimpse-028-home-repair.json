      "content": "Last year I fixed a leaky faucet by watching YouTube and improvising. Felt great to figure it out myself. Since then I've tried to fix three other things around the house - a door hinge, a loose tile, a stuck window. All three got worse. I watched tutorials, followed instructions exactly, bought the right tools. But somehow I'm making things worse instead of better. With the faucet I just figured it out as I went. Why can't I do that with other repairs? I keep looking for that same 'I got this' confidence but now I'm afraid to touch anything because I'll probably break it more."

      "content": "The faucet worked because you were responding to that specific problem, probably with some luck. That doesn't mean you've unlocked home repair skills you can now reliably apply.\n\nYou figured out one repair through a combination of: watching a tutorial, trying things, paying attention to what was actually happening. You didn't have a system - you had one successful problem-solving experience. That's great, but it's not a transferable method.\n\nNow you're approaching other repairs expecting to have the same \"I got this\" confidence. But different problems need different approaches. A faucet, a door hinge, tile, window - these are unrelated skills. Following tutorials exactly doesn't work if you're not actually understanding what the tutorial is addressing and whether your specific situation matches it.\n\nYou're making things worse probably because you're following instructions without understanding the underlying problem. The faucet, you were paying attention and improvising based on what you saw. Now you're following steps expecting them to work, not actually looking at what's happening. That's less competent, not more.\n\nThe fear that you'll break things more - that's realistic. You had one success and now you're approaching repairs with confidence that you haven't actually earned through skill development. You're not a handy person because you fixed one faucet. You're someone who successfully fixed one thing and is now in over your head on others."

That's one data point. You've now learned: jumping into repairs with confidence based on that one success leads to making things worse.\n\nYou can learn home repair. But that means: start with understanding the basics, practice simple fixes, build skill gradually. Not: try complex repairs expecting to improvise successfully because you did it once. The door hinge, tile, window - maybe those were harder than the faucet. Maybe you needed more foundational knowledge first.\n\nFollowing tutorials exactly without understanding won't work. Tutorials assume baseline knowledge. If you don't understand why you're doing each step, you can't adapt when your situation doesn't match exactly. That's where the \"making it worse\" comes from.\n\nYou're not helpless. But you're also not competent at home repair because of one faucet. Those aren't the only options. You can become more capable by actually learning, which means accepting that one success doesn't make you handy.\n\nFix what you're confident about after learning it properly. Call professionals for things you don't understand. That's not helpless - that's realistic about your current skill level. The faucet gave you false confidence. Now you know that. Start from where you actually are."
