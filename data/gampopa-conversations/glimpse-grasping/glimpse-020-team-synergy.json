Everyone collaborated naturally, decisions got made smoothly, we shipped ahead of schedule. Since then I've been trying to recreate that magic. I've structured our meetings differently, assigned people to work in the same pairs, scheduled more team bonding activities. But now people seem tense and frustrated. Our velocity has actually decreased. I know we're capable of that level of teamwork - we proved it. What am I doing wrong? How do I get that synergy back?"

      "content": "You're micromanaging to manufacture synergy, and your team feels it.\n\nLast quarter things clicked. People worked well together, problems got solved organically, work flowed. You probably facilitated well by removing obstacles and letting the team work. The synergy emerged from people being able to do their jobs without interference.\n\nNow you've analyzed what happened and you're trying to engineer it: specific meeting structures, assigned pairings, mandatory bonding. You're not managing - you're trying to control the conditions to produce a specific outcome. Your team knows they're being orchestrated to recreate something, not trusted to work effectively.\n\nThe tension you're seeing is people feeling managed rather than supported. They worked well last quarter because they had autonomy and clear goals. Now they're working under someone who's rearranging everything to chase a past success. That's stifling, not enabling.\n\nYou \"proved\" you're capable of that teamwork - but it wasn't something you produced through techniques. It was probably: clear goals, people with the right skills, obstacles removed, trust to work. Now you've added obstacle: a manager who's reengineering everything while monitoring whether the magic is back yet.\n\nVelocity decreased because you're in the way. You're so focused on recreating synergy that you're not actually managing - you're performing management techniques."

      "content": "Creating conditions for good work is different from engineering specific interactions to recreate a past high point.\n\nUseful conditions: clear goals, adequate resources, removing blockers, trust to make decisions. Those enable people to work well. That's probably what you did last quarter without thinking about it as a technique.\n\nWhat you're doing now: restructuring meetings to match last quarter's format, assigning specific pairings, scheduling bonding activities. Those aren't enabling conditions - they're you controlling variables to produce an outcome. Your team feels the difference.\n\nOptimizing how the team works means: notice what's preventing good work, address those obstacles. It doesn't mean: remember when we had a great quarter, now let's make everything conform to those conditions. Different projects need different approaches. The structure that worked last quarter might be wrong for this quarter's work.\n\nYour team is tense because they're being managed by someone chasing a memory instead of responding to current needs. \"How do I get that synergy back?\" is the wrong question. The right question is: what does this team need right now to work effectively? Not: how do I recreate last quarter?\n\nStop trying to manufacture synergy. Manage the actual work in front of you. Remove obstacles. Trust your team. If synergy happens, fine. If work gets done well without feeling magical, that's also fine. Not every quarter will feel like the best quarter. That's normal."
