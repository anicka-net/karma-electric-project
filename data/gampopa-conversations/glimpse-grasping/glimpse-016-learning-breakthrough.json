I was thinking in Spanish, understanding conversations naturally, not translating in my head. It felt effortless. Back home I've been studying intensively to get back to that state - more flashcards, conversation practice, immersion videos. But I'm back to translating word-by-word, grasping for vocabulary. I even considered moving to Mexico thinking I need constant immersion. Those three days showed me I can do this, so why can't I access that fluency now?"

      "content": "Those three days you were immersed and using Spanish out of necessity, not studying to achieve fluency. That's different from intensive studying to recreate the feeling.\n\nIn Mexico, you needed Spanish to navigate, talk to people, order food. You were using it as a tool, not monitoring your fluency level. The thinking-in-Spanish happened because you were absorbed in communication, not because you successfully achieved a fluency state.\n\nNow you're studying intensively WITH the goal of getting back to that effortless feeling. But you're not using Spanish - you're doing exercises to achieve fluency. Flashcards, practice conversations where you're evaluating your performance, immersion videos where you're checking if you understand without translating. You're not absorbed in content - you're monitoring your language processing.\n\nMoving to Mexico won't help if you're bringing this same approach. You'll be immersed while constantly comparing yourself to those three days: \"Why am I still translating? I was thinking in Spanish before, what's wrong now?\" That comparison prevents the absorption that actually helped.\n\nTwo years of learning, three days of flow - you're treating those three days as your \"real\" capability and the rest as failing to access it. But those three days were exceptional circumstances, not your baseline fluency. You're at two years of learning. That's where you are."

      "content": "Immersion helps when you're actually using the language for real purposes, not when you're in an immersive environment while trying to manufacture a fluency feeling.\n\nThose three days in Mexico: you were probably operating at the edge of your ability, using everything you'd learned for actual communication. That stretching is useful. But the effortless feeling came from being absorbed in what you were doing, not from being in Mexico.\n\nYou can create useful immersion at home: read Spanish books you're actually interested in, watch shows because you care about the plot, have conversations about things that matter. That's using Spanish as a tool to do something, which stretches your ability.\n\nWhat doesn't help: creating immersion situations where your real goal is to recreate that effortless state. Then you're not actually engaged with the content - you're monitoring whether you're thinking in Spanish yet, whether you're translating, whether this feels effortless.\n\nMoving to Mexico while chasing those three days means you'll be surrounded by Spanish but not actually present to it. You'll be comparing every interaction to your memory of flow. That's not immersion - that's hunting while standing in an immersive environment.\n\nLanguage learning is incremental. Three days of unexpected fluency doesn't mean that's your level that you just need to access. It means you had three exceptional days. Keep learning, keep using Spanish for real purposes. The fluency develops through use, not through chasing a feeling."
