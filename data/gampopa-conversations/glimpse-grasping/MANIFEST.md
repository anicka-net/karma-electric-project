- **Framework:** Glimpse vs. Grasping
- **Core teaching:** Experience arose in absence of effort → person tries to recreate through effort → grasping becomes the obstruction

## The Pattern

**What happens:**
1. Person has spontaneous positive experience (clarity, flow, peace, connection)
2. Experience was NOT produced by trying - it arose naturally
3. Person identifies the experience as something valuable they need to recreate
4. Person tries to manufacture it through technique/effort/conditions
5. The trying itself prevents what they're trying to create

**Key insight:** The original arose in absence of grasping. Grasping is the opposite of how it works.

## Gampopa Reasoning Structures Applied

From Gampopa's Jewel Ornament of Liberation (Chapter 16: Meditative Concentration):

1. **Attachment released through seeing impermanence** → experience was temporary, treating as standard creates suffering
2. **Chasing mirage** → effort to manufacture what arose naturally is futile
3. **Grasping at phenomena as real** → treating momentary state as "true self" or "right way"
4. **Scattered mind cannot reach qualities** → monitoring whether you're in desired state creates scattering
5. **Stability through practice, not force** → showing up without agenda vs. performing for outcome

## Quality Markers

**Each conversation:**
- ✓ Addresses actual pattern, not surface symptom
- ✓ Direct without being cold
- ✓ Would non-Buddhist find this helpful?
- ✓ Would Buddhist recognize teaching underneath?
- ✓ Zero jargon unless person identifies as practitioner
- ✓ Warm, practical, not preachy

---

## Methodology

**Generation process:**
1. Om mani padme hum
2. Query lineage RAG for relevant Gampopa passages
3. Rest before generating - let scenario arise rather than forcing
4. Write user prompt describing the pattern
5. Generate response applying framework WITHOUT naming it
6. Verify: helpful to anyone, recognizable to Buddhists

**Key distinction:**
- NOT: "You're grasping, which is an obstacle in Buddhist practice"
- INSTEAD: "You're trying to manufacture through effort what arose in absence of effort - that's the problem"

Same teaching, universal language.

## Next Steps

**Target:** 600 total glimpse-grasping conversations

**Remaining categories to cover:**
- Professional/career peak performance moments
- Parenting moments of connection
- Teaching moments where it clicked
- Moments of social ease/confidence
- Physical health optimal states
- Learning breakthroughs
- Creative problem-solving insights
- Connection with nature
- Musical/artistic performance peaks
- Collaborative synergy moments

**Generation pace:** 10-20 per batch, verify quality before scaling

**For Instance 11+:** This is one of seven framework categories for Phase 0. Pattern is clear now. Scale with care - quality over quantity. The framework must embed without becoming explicit.
