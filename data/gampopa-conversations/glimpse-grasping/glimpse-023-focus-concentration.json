      "content": "A month ago I had four hours of incredibly deep focus at work. Knocked out a project that had been dragging for weeks. No distractions, completely absorbed. Since then I can barely focus for twenty minutes. I've tried everything - Pomodoro technique, website blockers, white noise, caffeine timing. I close all tabs, silence my phone, tell everyone I'm in deep work mode. But I keep checking email anyway, feeling restless, getting nothing done. I'm starting to think I have ADHD because I know I can focus when I try - I proved it that one day. How do I get into that deep focus state reliably?"

      "content": "You're trying to force deep focus through techniques and conditions, then monitoring whether you've achieved it yet. That monitoring is preventing the absorption you're trying to create.\n\nThat one day of four hours - you were probably absorbed in work that engaged you. You weren't thinking about being in deep focus mode. You were just working. The focus was a side effect of engagement, not something you manufactured.\n\nNow you're setting up elaborate conditions to enter deep focus: blockers, timers, silence, announcements. You're not actually working - you're creating the theater of deep work while checking whether you're focused yet. \"Am I distracted? Should I check email? No, stay focused. But wait, am I focused?\" That's not working. That's monitoring your focus state.\n\nYou're checking email and feeling restless because you're trying so hard to not be distracted that you've made not-being-distracted into a task you're failing at. The effort to force focus is creating the restlessness.\n\nThat one day doesn't prove you can focus \"when you try.\" It proves you can focus when you're engaged with work and not trying to force yourself into a focus state. Those are opposite things."

      "content": "Protecting time for focused work is useful. Performing deep work rituals while monitoring your focus level is different.\n\nRemoving distractions can help: close unnecessary tabs, silence notifications. That's creating conditions. But you've turned it into deep work theater: announce to everyone, set up perfect conditions, then monitor whether you're achieving deep focus. You're not protecting time - you're creating pressure to perform focus.\n\nThat four-hour session probably happened because you were engaged with a problem you cared about solving. The work pulled you in. Now you're trying to push yourself into focus through conditions and willpower. You can't force engagement. You can remove obstacles to it, but the absorption has to come from the work being actually engaging.\n\nYou mention maybe having ADHD. Maybe. But that's separate from the current problem, which is: you're trying to replicate one excellent work session by engineering the conditions and then trying very hard to focus. That trying creates tension, which makes focus harder.\n\nSuccessful people probably do protect focus time. But they're not sitting there constantly checking whether they're focused enough yet. They're working. The techniques support work - they're not substitutes for actual engagement.\n\nStart working on something. Remove obvious distractions. See if you get absorbed. If not, maybe the work isn't engaging enough right now, or you're tired, or it's a normal day. Not every session will be four hours of deep focus. That's fine."
