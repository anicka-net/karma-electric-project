      "content": "I'm a high school math teacher. Last year I explained logarithms in a way that suddenly made sense to my students - I could see it click for them. I was improvising, using an example that just came to me in the moment. Best teaching I've ever done. This year I tried to replicate it. I planned out the exact example, scripted my explanation, even timed when I'd pause for questions. It fell completely flat. Students were confused and bored. I've now tried three different versions of that explanation with other classes and none work like the original. I even recorded myself that first time so I could review what I did right. What am I missing?"

      "content": "You're missing that the original worked because you were responding to that specific class in that specific moment, not following a script.\n\nLast year you were teaching logarithms, paying attention to your students, and an example came to you that fit what they needed right then. You were improvising based on what you were seeing. The click happened because you were actually responsive, not because you stumbled on the one perfect explanation.\n\nNow you're treating that moment as \"the correct way to teach logarithms.\" You've scripted it, timed it, recorded yourself. You're performing that successful moment instead of teaching the students in front of you. Of course it falls flat - you're not actually responsive to this class. You're trying to replay last year.\n\nThose students this year - they're different people with different confusions about logarithms. They need a different example, different pacing, different entry point. But you're not paying attention to what they need. You're trying to deliver the successful performance you already decided works.\n\nYou recorded yourself so you could review \"what you did right.\" But what you did right was: paid attention to students, noticed their confusion, responded to it. The specific example was just what fit that situation. It's not a formula."

      "content": "Refining explanations is useful. Treating one successful improvisation as the definitive method is different.\n\nYou can learn from what worked: maybe that class needed a concrete real-world example before abstract concepts. That's useful insight about how logarithms are confusing. But you've gone beyond that - you've scripted the exact example, timed the pauses. That's not using what you learned. That's trying to bottle spontaneity.\n\nThe recording probably shows you being responsive and present, explaining fluidly based on what you saw in your students' faces. But you're watching it like a script to memorize rather than noticing \"oh, I was paying attention and adapting in real time.\"\n\nYou can absolutely use what was successful. That example might be a good starting point. But when you deliver it as a scripted performance and it's not landing, that's information: these students need something different. The first class didn't respond because your delivery was perfect. They responded because you noticed their confusion and addressed it.\n\nYou're now teaching with one eye on your students and one eye on whether you're successfully replicating last year. That's split attention. You can't be responsive when you're busy performing a script you've decided is correct. The example is less important than the responsiveness."
