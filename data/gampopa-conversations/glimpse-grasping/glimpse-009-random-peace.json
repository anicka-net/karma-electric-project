      "content": "Last month I was washing dishes and suddenly felt completely at peace. No anxiety about work, no mental chatter, just hands in warm water and this profound okayness with everything. It lasted maybe five minutes. Since then I've been trying to get back there - I wash dishes mindfully, I try to recreate that feeling during other boring tasks, I've even started taking longer showers hoping it will happen again. But it won't come. I just end up frustrated that I'm doing dishes and nothing special is happening. What was that moment? How do I access it again?"

      "content": "You accessed it by not trying to access anything. That's why it's not coming back.\n\nLast month, washing dishes, you weren't trying to have a special experience. You were just washing dishes. Your mind happened to quiet down, anxiety happened to not be present in that moment, and you noticed feeling okay. It was temporary, spontaneous. Not manufactured.\n\nNow you're washing dishes WITH an agenda: trying to recreate that peace. You're not actually present to washing dishes - you're monitoring whether the special feeling is showing up yet. \"Is this it? No? What about now?\" That monitoring is exactly what prevents the quietness. You can't notice peace while constantly checking if you're peaceful.\n\nThe frustration you're feeling - \"I'm doing dishes and nothing special is happening\" - that's you being disappointed that the present moment isn't matching your memory of a past moment. You're not washing dishes. You're comparing right now to last month and finding it lacking.\n\nThat five minutes of peace was available because you weren't looking for it. Now you're looking. That's the problem. Trying to manufacture spontaneous okayness is like trying to surprise yourself - the trying prevents the thing."

      "content": "Mindfulness can help you notice what's actually happening. But you're using \"mindfulness\" as a technique to achieve a specific state you already decided you want.\n\nReal mindfulness would be: notice what washing dishes is actually like right now. The temperature, the slipperiness, your thoughts if they arise, your frustration if it's there. Just noticing what is.\n\nWhat you're doing: trying to use noticing as a method to produce peace. That's not being present - that's using a technique to manufacture an outcome. The outcome becomes more important than what's actually here.\n\nThat moment last month - you described it as \"profound okayness with everything.\" Okay with things being as they are. Now you're not okay with how things are. You want them to be like they were last month. That's the opposite of okayness with everything.\n\nYou can't deliberately access spontaneous peace. The deliberate accessing is grasping. The peace was the temporary absence of grasping. You're trying to grasp your way to non-grasping. See the problem?\n\nYou can notice what's here. You can stop comparing this moment to that one. That might create space for peace or it might not. But trying to create space in order to get peace collapses the space immediately."
