I use the same seed variety, same fertilizer schedule, obsessively control watering. But my tomatoes keep getting diseases or producing poorly. I've read every tomato growing guide, bought pH meters, track everything in a spreadsheet. Last year I started my seedlings at the exact same date as the successful year. Nothing works. Those tomatoes proved it's possible in my climate with my soil. Why can't I do it again? I'm doing everything more carefully and getting worse results."

      "content": "Because you're treating gardening like a recipe you can perfect through control, but plants respond to hundreds of variables you can't fully control.\n\nTwo years ago you had beginner's luck - good weather, your soil happened to work, pests weren't bad that year. You were probably relaxed and responding to what the plants looked like they needed. The success came from favorable conditions and reasonable care, not from you doing everything perfectly.\n\nNow you're trying to engineer that success through total control. Same seeds, same fertilizer schedule, tracking everything, obsessive watering control. But you can't control weather, pest populations, soil biology from year to year. The trying-to-control is probably making it worse - overwatering plants because you're following a schedule instead of checking if they need it, fertilizing on schedule rather than observing what the plants look like they need.\n\nThe spreadsheets and pH meters and exact planting dates - you're gardening through data rather than through actually looking at your plants. That first year you probably just paid attention to the plants themselves. Now you're paying attention to whether you're executing your system correctly. Those aren't the same thing."

Or: this fertilizer burned the plants, I'll use less. That's learning from what actually happened. What you're doing: the first year was perfect, so I'll replicate every detail of that year. But you can't replicate weather, pest pressure, the specific biological state your soil was in.\n\nThat first year, you probably watered when plants looked dry, fertilized when they seemed to need it. Basic responsiveness. Now you're watering on schedule whether plants need it or not, fertilizing on a calendar, starting seeds on a fixed date. You've turned responsive care into a rigid system.\n\nThe diseases and poor production - maybe your soil is depleted after two years. Maybe pests are worse this year. Maybe weather patterns are different. You can't see those things when you're focused on executing your system from the successful year. You're not actually gardening - you're trying to override current conditions through willpower.\n\nYou improve by: observing what actually happens, understanding what plants need, responding to this year's conditions. Not by assuming perfect execution of a system from one good year will produce the same results. Gardening doesn't work that way. Too many variables outside your control."
