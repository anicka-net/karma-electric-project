      "content": "I've had insomnia for years. Three weeks ago I slept eight hours straight for the first time in forever - woke up actually refreshed. I've been trying desperately to recreate that night ever since. I go to bed at the exact same time, use the same sheets, keep the room at the same temperature. I do progressive muscle relaxation, count breaths, listen to sleep meditations. But now I lie awake for hours, anxious about whether I'll sleep, monitoring how relaxed I am. I'm more exhausted than before because I'm trying so hard to sleep. Why won't my body just do what it did that one night?"

      "content": "Because you're treating sleep as something to achieve through effort, and effort is the opposite of sleep.\n\nThree weeks ago you slept. Maybe you were particularly tired, maybe stress was lower, maybe conditions happened to align. You weren't trying to make yourself sleep - you just slept. \n\nNow you're going to bed WITH a mission: recreate that eight hours. Same time, same temperature, same sheets - as if sleep is a recipe you can follow. But sleep isn't something you do. It's something that happens when you stop doing.\n\nAll those techniques - progressive relaxation, breath counting, meditation - you're using them to make yourself sleep. Lying there executing techniques while monitoring \"am I relaxed enough yet? Am I falling asleep?\" That monitoring is preventing sleep. You can't evaluate your way into unconsciousness.\n\nThe anxiety about whether you'll sleep is you lying awake worrying about lying awake. You're creating the insomnia through the desperate attempt to eliminate it. Every night that you don't sleep like that one night confirms you're not doing it right, which creates more anxiety, which prevents sleep more.\n\nYou're exhausted because trying hard to sleep is work, not rest. You're working all night to produce sleep instead of actually resting."

      "content": "Sleep hygiene is useful when it creates conditions for sleep, not when it becomes a desperate ritual to manufacture sleep.\n\nConsistent bedtime, cool room, dark space - those can help. But you've turned them into a formula you're executing while anxiously monitoring whether it's producing sleep. That's not hygiene - that's performance anxiety in bed.\n\nProgressive relaxation can be calming. But if you're lying there doing the technique while constantly checking \"am I asleep yet? Is this working?\" you're not relaxing - you're working. The technique becomes another thing to try, another way to fail when sleep doesn't come.\n\nYou're not choosing between trying techniques and accepting insomnia. There's a third option: create reasonable conditions for sleep, then let go of whether it happens. That's different from trying very hard to make it happen OR giving up.\n\nThat one night of eight hours - you're treating it as proof that you can sleep if you just do it right. But chronic insomnia doesn't mean you're failing at sleep. It means sleep is difficult for you. One good night doesn't mean you discovered the secret. It means you had one good night.\n\nYou might sleep tonight or you might not. Lying there desperately trying to force it guarantees you won't. Creating conditions and then actually letting go might or might not lead to sleep, but at least you're resting instead of working all night."
