You're outsourcing your sense of value to strangers' clicking behavior, which makes your stability dependent on their unpredictable attention.

The 'five minutes then anxious' pattern shows the validation isn't working. It's not actually making you feel valuable - it's providing temporary relief from the anxiety of feeling worthless. Then the anxiety returns and you need more validation. That's not confidence, it's addiction to external approval.

Notice: you're already calling it 'pathetic.' You judge yourself for needing validation while continuing to seek it. That creates a cycle: feel worthless, seek validation, get brief relief, feel worthless about needing validation, seek more validation."

Likes and comments aren't actually about your worth - they're about algorithms, timing, and other people's moods.

You can appreciate positive feedback without requiring it to feel valuable. The difference: do you feel basically okay when you post something that gets little engagement? Or does that confirm you're worthless? If it's the latter, your sense of value is held hostage by metrics you can't control.

The compulsive checking, the anxiety, the brief high followed by emptiness - those indicate you're not actually getting what you need from this. You're getting a temporary substitute that never satisfies. What you need isn't more likes. It's recognizing your value doesn't depend on strangers' approval. That's internal work, not something external validation can provide."
