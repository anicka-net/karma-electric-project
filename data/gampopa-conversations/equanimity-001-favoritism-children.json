Both kids want your love and approval. Both need to know they're valued. When you consistently light up for one and remain neutral or frustrated with the other, both kids notice. The 'difficult' one learns they're harder to love. The 'easy' one learns love is conditional on being pleasing.

The argumentative, boundary-pushing child might be difficult because they're struggling with something. Withdrawing warmth in response to difficulty makes them more difficult, not less. They're pushing to see if you'll still be there when they're not easy."

The 'difficult' child being harder to connect with - that's information about what they need, not about their worth. Maybe they need different kinds of connection. Maybe the argumentativeness is testing whether you'll reject them. Maybe the moodiness is struggling with something they can't articulate.

You can prefer spending time with one while still ensuring both receive attention, patience, and clear evidence they're valued. The test isn't 'do I feel the same way about both' but 'am I treating both as equally deserving of my care.' Your feelings will vary. Your care shouldn't."
