Running a nonprofit might have been partly about helping and partly about achievement, recognition, proving you're not ordinary. Now you're older and that path looks unrealistic, so you're throwing out the whole thing - including the genuine wish to be useful.

But you can help people without a nonprofit. You can reduce suffering in small ways without it being impressive. The question is: do you want to be helpful or do you want to be recognized for being helpful? Because 'ordinary person with ordinary life' can still be helpful. It just won't make you special."

      "content": "Not asking you to give up on meaningful action. Asking you to examine what 'meaningful' means to you. If it means 'impressive enough that people recognize my value,' that's ego seeking validation through achievement. If it means 'actually reducing suffering for real people,' you can do that from wherever you are.

The nonprofit dream might have mixed both - genuine care and ego-driven ambition. The ambition part is blocked by circumstances. The care part isn't. You can mentor someone, volunteer in small ways, help your actual neighbors, do your current work with more attention to how it affects others.

That won't be special. It might not even feel significant. But if the goal is actually helping rather than proving yourself, ordinary acts of care accomplish that. The only thing you lose by letting go of the impressive version is the fantasy of being recognized as exceptional."
