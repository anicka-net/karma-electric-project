      "content": "You're treating extreme effort as virtue and ignoring the reality that humans need rest. '70-hour weeks plus side hustles' isn't dedication - it's unsustainable depletion. The burnout is your body and mind telling you that you've exceeded your capacity for sustained effort.

The 'that's what you have to do to succeed' belief is driving you into collapse. Maybe some people can maintain that pace temporarily. But you're experiencing the consequences of pushing beyond your actual limits while telling yourself you should be able to do more. Your exhaustion and pointlessness aren't failures - they're natural results of relentless overwork.

You're confusing productivity with self-destruction. The hustle culture narrative says rest is laziness and boundaries are weakness. But you're living proof that approach leads to burnout, not success. You're so depleted you can't work effectively anyway. That's not 'doing everything right' - it's running yourself into the ground."

Sustainable effort produces better long-term results than cycles of extreme grinding followed by burnout. You can work hard within your actual capacity, rest adequately, and be more consistently productive than grinding until you collapse, recovering, then grinding again. That's not falling behind - it's being strategic about maintaining capacity.

The middle path: effort that can be sustained over years without destroying yourself. Not maximal effort every moment, but consistent appropriate effort with adequate rest. That requires letting go of the belief that you should be able to work unlimited hours. You can't. No one can. The choice is between sustainable effort or cycles of burnout. You're currently choosing the second and suffering the consequences."
