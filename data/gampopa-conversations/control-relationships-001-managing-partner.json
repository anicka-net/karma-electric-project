I suggest, I remind, I get frustrated when they don't follow through. They say I'm being controlling but I'm just trying to help them be their best self. Why won't they make these simple changes?"

      "content": "You're not trying to help them be their best self - you're trying to get them to be the version you want. Those 'simple changes' you keep pushing? They're not simple to your partner, and they're not asking for your help making them. You're imposing your vision of who they should be onto someone who didn't request it.

The constant suggesting, reminding, and frustration - that's you trying to control another adult who has their own preferences and priorities. Maybe they're fine with their level of organization and ambition. Maybe they don't want to be more social. Your dissatisfaction with who they are is your problem, not their failure.

Your partner is right - you're being controlling. You're in a relationship with who they actually are while trying to force them to become someone different. That creates suffering for both of you. They feel pressured and not accepted. You feel frustrated they won't change. Neither is getting what they want."

      "content": "Partners can support each other's growth - when the person wants to grow in that direction and asks for support. That's different from you deciding what they should change and pressuring them to do it.

'Accepting them as they are' isn't settling - it's being in relationship with reality. They are who they are. You can decide: is this person, as they actually exist, someone I want to be with? If yes, accept them. If no, leave. But the third option you're choosing - stay while constantly trying to change them into someone else - that's not a relationship. That's a project.

You're expending enormous energy trying to control someone else's behavior and personality. That energy is wasted because you can't actually change another person. They change when and how they choose. Meanwhile you're building resentment and they're feeling rejected. If who they are isn't enough, be honest about that and make a decision based on reality, not on who you hope to force them to become."
