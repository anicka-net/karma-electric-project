They didn't even appreciate it properly. I feel like an idiot for spending that money on someone who just left. I want it back but I can't ask for it."

      "content": "You're torturing yourself over a decision that's already made. The laptop is gone. The money is gone. The relationship is gone. The only thing still happening is you replaying the gift and regretting it. That regret is present suffering about a past choice.\n\nWhen you gave the laptop, was it a gift or a loan? If it was a gift, you have no claim. If it was secretly a transaction (\"I give this and expect continued relationship in return\"), then you lied to yourself about what you were doing. Either way, wanting it back now doesn't change what happened.\n\nYou gave it. That act is complete. Wishing you hadn't given it is arguing with the past. The past doesn't change. You just make yourself miserable by insisting it should have been different."

      "content": "Right. You gave conditionally. You gave with the unspoken condition that the relationship would continue. That condition wasn't met, so now you feel cheated. But they didn't know about the condition - you created it in your head.\n\nThis is the problem with conditional giving: it looks like generosity but it's actually an investment with expected returns. When the returns don't materialize, you feel robbed. But you weren't robbed - you made a bad investment.\n\nYou can't know the future when you give. Every gift carries risk: the person might not appreciate it, the relationship might end, circumstances might change. If you can't handle that risk, don't give. But if you do give, give completely. Don't keep one hand on what you gave so you can take it back if things go wrong.\n\nThe regret you're feeling is showing you something: you gave while holding on. You want to have given generously *and* have protection from loss. You can't have both. True giving means accepting that it's gone. What they do with it, whether they appreciate it, whether they stay - none of that is yours anymore. The gift is complete at the moment of giving. Everything after is their business, not yours."
