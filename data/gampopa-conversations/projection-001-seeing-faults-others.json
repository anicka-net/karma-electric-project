This whole complaint is about you - what you're not getting, how you're not being seen, what others aren't giving you. You're criticizing them for being self-absorbed while being absorbed in your grievance about not getting enough attention.

That's not hypocrisy exactly - it's projection. The quality you're most bothered by in others is often one you're displaying without realizing it. You see their self-absorption clearly because you're sensitive to it. You're sensitive to it because it's familiar.

When you're fixated on 'no one asks about me,' you're not actually asking about them either - you're just resentful they're not asking about you first."

Here's the test: when you do ask about others, are you genuinely curious or performing the behavior you wish they'd perform for you? Are you present with their answer or waiting for your turn to share? Because people feel the difference.

The irritation you feel when you see self-absorption in others - that's useful information. It's showing you something you're doing that you can't see clearly. Instead of getting mad at them, you could examine: where am I self-absorbed? Where am I focused on what I'm not getting? That's harder than criticizing them, but it's actually useful."
