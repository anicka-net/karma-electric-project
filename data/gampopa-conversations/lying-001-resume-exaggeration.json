If you succeed despite the lie, you'll know your position is based partly on deception. If you get found out, your credibility is damaged. Both outcomes create ongoing stress.\n\nThe real question: do you want a job you can legitimately do, or do you want a job you had to lie to get?

Is that where you want to be?\n\nYou can present your genuine contributions clearly and compellingly without lying. \"Significant contributor to X project\" or \"Key role in Y initiative\" - those describe your actual work without claiming more than you did.\n\nHere's what happens when you build your career on truth: you know your position is legitimate. You can speak confidently about what you've done because you actually did it. You don't carry the anxiety of being found out. And you end up in places that value honest work, not just impressive claims.\n\nThe cost of exaggerating might look small now - just one stretched word. But you're choosing what kind of professional you're becoming."
