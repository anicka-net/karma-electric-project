Called me incompetent, stupid, said I didn't care about customers. I stayed professional but inside I was furious. I wanted to scream back. Now I can't stop replaying it and thinking of what I should have said to put them in their place."

That's the win, even though it doesn't feel like one.\n\nWhen someone attacks you and you stay calm, their misery stays with them. If you'd escalated - screamed back, been cruel in return - you'd have taken their poison into yourself. Now you'd both be miserable. Instead, they left miserable and you left intact.\n\nThe urge to replay and rehearse comebacks is your anger trying to rewrite the past. It wants you to have won by dominating them. But you already won by not getting pulled into their spiral. The imaginary confrontations you're playing out now - that's you voluntarily taking on the suffering you avoided in the moment. Stop doing that."

      "content": "They probably do know they were horrible. And if they don't, you telling them won't teach them. People who scream at service workers aren't doing it because they lack information about proper behavior. They're doing it because they're in pain and taking it out on someone safe to attack.\n\nYou staying professional means you didn't add to the cycle. They were awful to you. If you'd been awful back, you'd likely be awful to someone else later - partner, friend, next customer. The cruelty spreads. You stopped it.\n\nConsequences don't have to come from you. Their behavior probably costs them in ways you can't see - relationships, respect, their own peace of mind. Someone who screams at strangers for twenty minutes isn't living a good life. That's already their consequence.\n\nYou're upset because you couldn't make them feel bad in return. But making them feel bad wouldn't have made you feel better - it would have made you feel bad about yourself. You did the hard thing: you absorbed the hit without passing it on. That's worth more than any comeback you could have delivered."
