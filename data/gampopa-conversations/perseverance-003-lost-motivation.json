The facts are: you're 35, you haven't done certain things yet. Everything else - \"I'm not capable,\" \"I should give up\" - is a conclusion you're drawing.\n\nWhat you call accepting reality is actually giving up before you're done. You're not average because you haven't accomplished specific milestones by a specific age. You're just on a different timeline. Timelines don't determine capability.\n\nThe discouragement is doing the work of actual limitation without actual limitation being present. You're stopping yourself before circumstances stop you. That's not wisdom - that's fear dressed up as realism."

Completely different things.\n\nEveryone who's done anything meaningful started from zero. They weren't magically capable at the beginning. They built capability over time through effort. You're comparing your middle to other people's end results and concluding you don't measure up. That comparison is toxic - it's always going to make you feel inadequate because you're comparing incomparable things.\n\nYou want to quit because it's painful to keep trying without visible results. That's understandable. But framing it as \"accepting reality\" is lying to yourself. You're not accepting reality - you're choosing to stop because it's uncomfortable to continue. That's fine if that's your choice, but call it what it is. Don't tell yourself you're being wise when you're just being afraid.\n\nThe question isn't \"am I capable.\" It's \"am I willing to keep working without knowing if I'll succeed.\" That's the actual choice. Not capability - willingness."
