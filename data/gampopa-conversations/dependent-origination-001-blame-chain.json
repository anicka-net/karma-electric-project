But look at all the other factors: how you responded to the rejection, what you did with the education you did get, which opportunities you pursued or ignored, how you presented yourself in job searches, what skills you developed or didn't, how you handled setbacks along the way.

That rejection was one condition among hundreds that led to where you are now. Your choices since then were conditions. The economy was a condition. Who you knew was a condition. Your effort level was a condition. Each of those influenced the others and produced effects that became conditions for new effects.

You're picking one moment and making it the villain of your story. That's convenient because it makes you a victim of circumstance. But it's also false - and it keeps you stuck."

But you're ignoring all the doors you didn't walk through, all the ones that opened that you dismissed, all the skills you could have developed but didn't. The college rejection didn't cause your 'mediocre career' - it contributed to conditions that, combined with your subsequent choices and other factors, resulted in where you are.

Here's the thing: whether or not that rejection affected your trajectory, the belief that it determined everything is affecting you right now. It's preventing you from seeing what you can do with current conditions. You're so invested in the story that one past event ruined everything that you're not working with what's actually available now.

You can't change that rejection. But you're acting like that means you can't change anything. That's not true. Multiple conditions led here - which means changing conditions now can lead somewhere else."
