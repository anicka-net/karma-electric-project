What's actually hurting you is your reaction to it - the decision that this matters so much it must be corrected, that you can't let it stand, that being wrong in public is intolerable.\n\nThe person who wrote it probably forgot about it five minutes later. You're carrying it for hours or days. That's not their doing - that's you holding onto it, feeding it, keeping it alive by checking back and rehearsing responses.\n\nYou're making yourself fragile by treating every challenge to your view as a wound. The wound isn't from them - it's from how you're relating to disagreement."

To make them see they're wrong. To get validation that you're right. That's why you keep checking back, why it eats at you when they don't concede.\n\nHere's the test: if you post a correction and they never respond, can you let it go? Or do you need them to acknowledge you were right? If it's the latter, you're not fighting misinformation - you're seeking validation through argument. And that will never satisfy because strangers on the internet have no obligation to give you what you're looking for."
