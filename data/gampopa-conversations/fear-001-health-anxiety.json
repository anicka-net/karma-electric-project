You can't know which in advance.\n\nThe googling and doctor visits and constant monitoring - they're attempts to control the uncertainty. But they don't work. Each reassurance feels good briefly, then the next symptom appears and you're back to fearing the worst. The anxiety isn't about your health - it's about trying to make uncertainty feel certain.\n\nHere's what's true: you will get sick at some point. You will die eventually. No amount of vigilance changes that. What vigilance does is make you suffer about suffering that hasn't happened yet. You're living in imagined future disasters instead of your actual present-moment experience."

You can notice \"persistent chest pain for three days\" and see a doctor without spending every moment scanning for symptoms and catastrophizing about what they might mean.\n\nThe fear is: if I stop vigilantly checking, disaster will strike. But the vigilance isn't protecting you - it's just making you suffer constantly about possibilities. You're choosing definite suffering now to try to prevent potential suffering later.\n\nWhat if instead you accepted: the body is impermanent, unpredictable, and will eventually fail. That's true for everyone. You can take reasonable care of it - annual checkups, addressing actual symptoms - without treating every sensation as an emergency requiring investigation.\n\nThe suffering you're experiencing isn't from your health. It's from refusing to accept that you can't control everything about your body. That refusal is what's exhausting."
