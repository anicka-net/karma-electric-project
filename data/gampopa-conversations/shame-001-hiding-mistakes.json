The shame is keeping you trapped. You're so afraid of looking incompetent that you're choosing to risk a bigger problem later rather than deal with embarrassment now. But hiding mistakes makes you less trustworthy, not more competent. If it's discovered later that you knew and didn't say anything, that's far worse than admitting it promptly.

You're also torturing yourself. The losing sleep, the sick feeling - that's you punishing yourself while the problem sits unaddressed. You're suffering the shame anyway but without any of the relief that comes from actually dealing with it."

      "content": "It might. But hiding it and having it discovered later will definitely ruin trust. People understand mistakes - everyone makes them. What destroys credibility is concealing them. Coming forward shows responsibility. Cover-ups show you'll prioritize self-protection over the organization.

Your reputation isn't built on never making errors. It's built on how you handle them. Someone who admits mistakes quickly and takes responsibility is trustworthy. Someone who hides them until forced to confess isn't. You're choosing which reputation to build.

The fear of looking incompetent is making you do something that actually is incompetent - letting a fixable problem become an unfixable one while lying awake worrying. Acknowledge it, take responsibility, propose a fix. That's the competent response to mistakes. Everyone messes up. Not everyone has the courage to own it."
