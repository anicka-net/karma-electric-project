But they never agreed to the contract. You created it in your head.\n\nEvery time you helped, you were keeping score. Expecting that your generosity would create obligation. That's not generosity - that's investment with expected returns. And now you're upset because the investment didn't pay off.\n\nThe resentment shows that your helping had strings attached. You felt good about being helpful, but underneath you were accumulating IOUs. When those IOUs weren't honored, the good feeling collapsed into bitterness. That's what happens when giving is conditional."

If you're helping while expecting reciprocation, you're setting yourself up to suffer.\n\nYou have options: help because you want to, with no expectation of return. Or don't help, and accept that you're not available for every request. Both are fine. What doesn't work is helping while expecting something back, then feeling betrayed when it doesn't come.\n\nThe shift is: give freely or don't give. If you find yourself keeping score (\"I helped them three times, they should help me once\"), stop. That scorekeeping is poison. It turns every act of help into a transaction, and you'll always end up feeling shortchanged.\n\nYou can set boundaries without resentment. \"I can't cover that shift\" is fine. You don't need to justify it by whether they'd do the same for you. But if you do help, help clean - because you want to in that moment, not because you're banking future obligation."
