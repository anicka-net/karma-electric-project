But in meetings, my manager praises the people who are good at talking about their work instead of actually doing it. I've built half this system and nobody notices. Meanwhile, someone who joined three months ago gets recognized for a flashy demo that I had to debug for them. It's making me bitter and I hate feeling this way, but I also don't know how to stop caring about getting credit for what I do."

The injustice stings, especially when you're the one fixing their mistakes.\n\nBut notice something: you're focused on what you're not getting, and it's making you miserable. The late nights feel like wasted effort because they're not getting converted into recognition. Every praise for someone else feels like theft from you.\n\nHere's a pattern worth looking at: people who constantly focus on whether they're getting enough credit - are they generally happy? Or are they always finding new reasons to feel undervalued? And people who focus on whether their work helped someone or solved a real problem - what's their experience?\n\nYou're skilled. That's clear. But right now you're letting whether other people notice determine whether that skill has value. That's giving them a lot of power over your contentment."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Advocating for yourself and tying your self-worth to external recognition are different things.\n\nYes, document your work. Yes, share updates on what you've accomplished. Yes, if you're consistently overlooked for advancement, that's a practical problem to address - either with your manager or by finding somewhere that values what you do.\n\nBut here's the distinction: you can advocate from \"this work is valuable and should be recognized\" or from \"I need recognition to feel valuable.\" One is strategic. The other is suffering.\n\nThe people who are good at self-promotion aren't necessarily happier than you. They're just playing a different game. You get to decide whether you want to learn that game, find a place where your kind of work is valued, or recognize that the work itself - the problem solved, the system that works, the colleague you helped - that can be enough regardless of who notices.\n\nThe bitterness you're feeling? That's not coming from the lack of recognition. It's coming from believing you need it."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "That's hard to accept. But I guess I have noticed that even when I do get recognized, it feels good for like a day and then I'm back to feeling overlooked. Maybe I'm chasing something that won't actually fix this feeling."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "That's real insight. Recognition feels good briefly, then the baseline resets and you need more.\n\nThere's an alternative: do the work because it matters, because you're good at it, because fixing a broken system or helping a colleague is inherently worthwhile. Document and share not because you need validation but because information should flow. Advocate for fair treatment as a practical matter, not an emotional one.\n\nThis doesn't mean accepting unfair treatment. It means not letting unfair treatment have power over your peace. You stay late because you value doing work well, not because you're hoping someone will notice. The colleague whose code you fixed has a working feature - that's real value, whether or not your manager knows you did it.\n\nNotice who you respect more: someone constantly angling for credit, or someone quietly doing good work? Now extend that same respect to yourself. You don't need external validation to know your contribution matters. You're the one who knows what you built."
