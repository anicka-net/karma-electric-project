So you check again, chasing the next hit.\n\nThe phone isn't the problem - it's the pattern of seeking satisfaction in something that can't provide it. Each check promises it'll finally be enough, and it never is. That's the nature of what you're grasping at - it can't deliver what you're asking of it.\n\nNotice: when do you reach for the phone? Probably when you're bored, anxious, uncomfortable, avoiding something. You're using it to fill a gap. But the gap doesn't get filled. You just temporarily distract yourself from noticing it."

Don't fight it, don't give in - just observe it. \"There's the pull to check.\" It'll probably feel uncomfortable. Sit with that discomfort for ten seconds. Then decide.\n\nMost of the time you'll still check the phone. That's fine. But you're building awareness of the gap between urge and action. Over time, that gap grows. The urge stops feeling so urgent. You start noticing when you're reaching for distraction versus when you actually need information.\n\nThe compulsion loses power when you see it clearly - not as something wrong with you, but as a pattern of seeking satisfaction where it can't be found. You're not fixing anything. You're just watching the pattern until it stops having so much grip."
