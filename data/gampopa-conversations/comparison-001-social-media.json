But even if you could see their full reality, you'd find the same thing: nobody has it completely figured out. They're all dealing with their own versions of struggle, dissatisfaction, and trying to measure up.\n\nThe feeling that you're never enough - that's not coming from actually being inadequate. It's coming from believing there's some level of achievement or happiness where you'd finally feel complete. There isn't. People with \"better\" jobs are still looking at someone else with an even better job. People in happy relationships still have hard days.\n\nYou're suffering from comparison, not from your actual life."

But do it because it's meaningful, not because you think it'll finally make you feel adequate.\n\nThe trap is thinking: \"Once I achieve X, I'll feel complete.\" That's the same trap the people you're envying are in. They achieved something and the feeling of completeness lasted maybe a day, then they were back to measuring themselves against the next level.\n\nYou can work toward better things while accepting that no achievement will make you permanently satisfied. That acceptance isn't resignation - it's freedom from the exhausting chase. You're already adequate. Your life is already real. The dissatisfaction isn't from lacking something - it's from believing you should feel permanently satisfied, which nobody does."
