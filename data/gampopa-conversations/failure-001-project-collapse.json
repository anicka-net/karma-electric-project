That's how things work. It's not failure - it's impermanence.\n\nWhat you built was always going to end eventually. This time it was funding. Later it might be market changes, or someone else building something better, or you moving on to something else. The form was never going to last. What matters is what you learned and what you do next."

You can carry it as evidence you're a failure, or you can carry it as experience you now have.\n\nMost people who build anything significant have multiple projects fail. The difference between people who recover and people who don't isn't whether they fail - everyone does. It's whether they treat failure as information (\"this approach didn't work, what do I try next\") or identity (\"I am a failure\").\n\nYou're in the space right now where it feels like collapse. That's real. Sit with it. Grieve what you built. Then, when you're ready, extract what you learned and carry that forward. The project ending doesn't mean you're broken. It means you're someone who tried something difficult and it didn't work. That's courage, not failure."
