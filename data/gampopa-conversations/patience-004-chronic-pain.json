I'm angry all the time - at my body, at the doctors, at people who get to live without pain. How do I not be angry when this is my reality?"

      "content": "The pain is already difficult. Then you're adding a layer of rage and resistance on top of it. The pain is the first arrow. Your anger about having pain is the second arrow. You're being hit twice.\n\nYou can't control the pain. But the resistance - the \"this shouldn't be happening,\" the hatred of your body, the comparison to people without pain - that's suffering you're creating. The pain is unavoidable. The rage about the pain is optional, even though it doesn't feel optional right now.\n\nResistance makes pain worse. When you're fighting it, you're tense, which amplifies pain. When you're hating your body, you're at war with yourself. That war is exhausting and it makes the pain experience more unbearable. The pain is already there. The war with it doesn't make it go away - it just makes everything harder."

      "content": "Acceptance isn't giving up. It's stopping the fight that makes things worse. You can work with doctors, try treatments, manage what you can - all while accepting that right now, in this moment, pain is present.\n\nAcceptance means: the pain is here. Resisting that fact doesn't change it. What changes is how you relate to it. Instead of \"I hate this, this shouldn't be happening, why me\" - which adds suffering - you move toward \"this is difficult, and it's what's here now.\"\n\nThat shift doesn't make the pain less intense. But it removes the layer of anguish about having the pain. You're not using energy to fight reality. You're using energy to work with it. Some days that means resting. Some days it means functioning despite it. But you're not adding the torture of wishing it weren't there.\n\nPeople who live well with chronic conditions often say the same thing: they stopped fighting the fact of it. They grieve what they lost, they adapt, they find what's still possible. But they don't spend energy being at war with their own body. That war has no winner - it just creates more suffering."
