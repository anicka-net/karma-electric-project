The measuring is constant because there's always someone ahead in something. You can feel superior in one domain and immediately find someone doing better in another domain. The comparing never stops because you're trying to establish worth through comparison, and comparison can never provide lasting sense of value.

Notice the results: exhaustion, brief superiority that turns to guilt, pervasive sense of failure. The comparison isn't helping you improve or feel better. It's just creating constant evaluation anxiety and preventing you from engaging with your actual life."

      "content": "There's a difference between using others for information ('they approached that problem cleverly, I could try that') and using them to measure your worth. One is learning, the other is scorekeeping.

You can assess whether you're doing well based on: are you developing? Are you applying effort? Are you contributing something? Are you aligned with your values? Those are standards you can work with. 'Am I better than this person and worse than that person' - that's just anxiety-producing scorekeeping that doesn't actually help you grow.

The comparison makes you perpetually insecure because you're never definitively ahead. There's always someone further along. And even when you are ahead, it doesn't satisfy - you immediately feel guilty or find a new person to measure against. That's not motivation. That's torturing yourself with an impossible standard that can't be met because it's relative and constantly shifting."
