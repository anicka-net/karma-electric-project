      "content": "You're maintaining two stories simultaneously: 'I want to change' and 'not right now.' The excuses let you feel like someone who wants to change without actually changing. That's comfortable - you get to keep the self-image without the work.

The lying works because you're not examining the excuses. 'Too busy' - busy with what that's more important than your health? 'Too tired' - exercise gives energy, so you're choosing the tiredness cycle. 'I'll start Monday' - what's different about Monday except that it's not now?

You know you're lying but you're accepting the lies because they're convenient. The question isn't how to stop bullshitting yourself. You know how - stop accepting the excuses. The question is whether you want to change more than you want to stay comfortable."

      "content": "You're trying your best to want to change. You're not trying your best to actually change. Those are different.

This isn't about being harsh - it's about being honest. 'I'm too busy' is gentler than 'I'm prioritizing other things over my health,' but the second one is true and the first one isn't. You can be compassionate about why you're not changing while still being honest that you're not.

The self-deception keeps you stuck. You tell yourself comforting lies, nothing changes, you feel bad about that, so you tell yourself more comforting lies. Being honest - 'I'm choosing not to exercise right now because it's uncomfortable and I don't want to' - that gives you something to work with. You can examine that choice. You can't examine a lie you're pretending to believe."
