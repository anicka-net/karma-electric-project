The panic comes from treating that reality as an emergency rather than a fact.\n\nEvery visit where you notice the changes, you're seeing impermanence directly. Her body is failing. Your time together is limited. That's devastating AND it's the nature of having a body, being alive, being in relationship with mortal beings.\n\nYou can spend the remaining time in panic, trying to avoid the reality, or you can be present for what's actually here now. She's still here. You can still talk, sit together, share meals. But you won't be able to if you're consumed with grief about her not being here in the future."

It means not adding panic and avoidance on top of grief. You'll be devastated when she dies - that's love meeting impermanence. But you can be devastated AND have been present with her while she was here. Or you can be devastated AND regret spending her final years in anticipatory grief instead of actual relationship.\n\nWhat if instead of trying to not lose her - which you can't control - you focused on fully being with her now? Having real conversations while she can still have them. Sitting with her while she's still here to sit with. Letting her know she's loved while she can still hear it.\n\nHer death will hurt. But the time before it doesn't have to be swallowed by dread. That's a choice you're making about how to spend the time you have."
