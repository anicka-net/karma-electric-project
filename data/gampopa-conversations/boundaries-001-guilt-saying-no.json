When you say yes while already overwhelmed, you're not helping from a place of genuine care - you're helping from guilt and fear of being seen as selfish. The resentment you feel while helping is evidence of that. You're overriding your actual limits to maintain an image of being the person who always helps.

The result is you burn out, your help becomes lower quality, and eventually you have nothing left to give. That's not more ethical than setting boundaries. It's just martyrdom disguised as generosity."

Setting boundaries isn't refusing to help - it's being honest about your limits so you can help sustainably. You can say 'I can't help with this right now' without being selfish. You can prioritize some requests over others based on what you can actually manage.

The guilt you feel isn't coming from violating your values. It's coming from violating the belief that you should never have limits. But having limits isn't a moral failing - it's reality. You can work within your limits and still be helpful. You can say no without being a bad person. The alternative is eventual collapse."
