You have enough money now. But you can't experience having enough because you're fixated on all the ways you might lose it. The anxiety isn't proportional to actual risk - it's coming from the belief that security requires infinite resources and anything less means imminent collapse.

The result: you're depriving yourself of things you want and could afford, not contributing to causes that matter to you, and living in constant anxiety despite being objectively comfortable. You're suffering poverty mindset while having actual resources. The scarcity is in your thinking, not in your circumstances."

You can have emergency savings and still experience having enough in daily life. You can be prudent without hoarding out of fear. The scarcity mindset doesn't make you more prepared - it makes you unable to recognize when you actually have enough, so no amount of saving ever feels secure.

The test: is there an amount that would feel like enough? Or would you always find new catastrophes to worry about and new reasons to not spend or give? If there's no amount that would satisfy the anxiety, then the problem isn't insufficient resources - it's the mindset that treats any expenditure as dangerous. That mindset will keep you anxious whether you have a little or a lot."
