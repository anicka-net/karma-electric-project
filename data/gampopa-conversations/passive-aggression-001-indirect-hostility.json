      "content": "You're expressing anger indirectly through passive-aggressive behavior. That's not avoiding conflict - it's creating ongoing low-grade hostility while maintaining plausible deniability. You're punishing them without giving them information about what the problem is or opportunity to address it.

They're getting the message that you're upset. What they're not getting is what they did or what you need. So they can't fix the problem. You're just creating tension and confusion while saying 'I'm fine.' That's not protecting the relationship - it's poisoning it with unexpressed anger.

The passive-aggression is you trying to punish without having to own your anger. 'I'm not mad, I just keep doing things that upset you and being cold.' That's cowardly. If you're angry enough to be hostile, be honest about it. Otherwise you're just making things worse while pretending you're not doing anything."

      "content": "Direct conversation might be uncomfortable. But passive-aggression is worse - it creates ongoing tension, damages trust, and prevents resolution. They can't 'figure it out' if you won't tell them what's wrong. Mind-reading isn't a real solution.

You think you're avoiding conflict but you've just replaced one clear conversation with weeks of cold hostility and confusion. That's more damaging to the relationship than saying 'Hey, I'm upset about X, can we talk about it?'

The passive-aggression lets you stay in the victim position - 'I'm not causing problems, I'm just withdrawing.' But withdrawal paired with subtle hostility is causing problems. You're making them guess, punishing them for guessing wrong, denying you're upset, and wondering why things don't improve. That's not avoiding conflict - it's choosing covert warfare over honest conversation. One difficult conversation would be more respectful and effective than this ongoing campaign of indirect hostility."
