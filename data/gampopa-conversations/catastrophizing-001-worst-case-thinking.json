      "content": "You're taking one piece of critical feedback and escalating it into complete life collapse. That's not realistic assessment - it's catastrophizing. Each step in your chain of disaster requires multiple unlikely events: critical feedback → getting fired → can't find any job → lose apartment → homelessness. Each of those is a huge leap that's far from certain.

Most likely reality: you got some critical feedback on one project. That's it. It might mean you need to improve something. It probably doesn't mean you're getting fired. But you've jumped straight to the worst possible outcome and convinced yourself it's inevitable.

The catastrophizing isn't preparing you for anything. It's making you suffer through an imagined worst-case scenario that probably won't happen. You're experiencing job loss and homelessness mentally even though you're currently employed with a place to live."

      "content": "There's a difference between realistic risk assessment and catastrophic thinking. Realistic: 'I got critical feedback, I should address the concerns and improve.' Catastrophic: 'This will definitely lead to me being homeless.'

You're not preparing for bad outcomes - you're suffering them in advance with certainty they'll occur. That doesn't make you more ready if something bad actually happens. It just means you've suffered the catastrophe twice: once in imagination and once if it actually occurs (which is unlikely).

Most problems don't escalate to worst-case scenarios. You could get fired without becoming homeless. You could get critical feedback without getting fired. But catastrophizing leaps to the most extreme outcome and treats it as inevitable. That's not preparation - it's torture through imagination. You can be aware of risks and take reasonable precautions without mentally living through disaster that probably won't happen."
