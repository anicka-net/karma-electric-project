      "content": "You're experiencing the pain of attachment - not attachment in the sense of love, but attachment as clinging. You love your daughter and you also want her to stay nearby for your comfort. Those are different things.

If she stays to keep you from feeling loss, she gives up an opportunity she wants. That's asking her to manage your discomfort at the cost of her growth. You're framing it as 'reasons she should stay' but really they're reasons you want her to stay.

The love part wants her to thrive and grow and take opportunities that are good for her. The clinging part wants her to stay close because that's easier for you. Both are present. But letting the clinging part control the decision - that's prioritizing your comfort over her wellbeing."

You can support her move and grieve the distance. You can tell her you'll miss her while helping her pack. You can feel sad without making her responsible for that sadness. That's love without clinging - wanting her wellbeing even when it means more distance, more independence, less of the closeness you've relied on.

The alternative is she stays and you get what you want while she wonders what she gave up. Or she goes and carries guilt because you made it clear her leaving hurts you. Neither is love - both are attachment trying to prevent loss by limiting her freedom."
