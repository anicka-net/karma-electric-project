But no one appreciates it. They take me for granted and never ask how I'm doing. I'm starting to resent them but I can't stop helping because then I'd be selfish."

      "content": "You're not helping from generosity - you're helping from a need to be seen as selfless. The resentment is evidence of that. Genuine generosity doesn't keep score or demand recognition. You're keeping detailed accounts of what you've given and what you're not getting back.

The 'I can't stop or I'd be selfish' framing is revealing. You're not afraid of being selfish - you're afraid of losing your identity as the selfless one. That identity requires constant sacrifice to maintain. And it requires others to recognize your sacrifice, which they're not doing enough to satisfy you.

This is martyrdom, not generosity. You're sacrificing to build resentment and moral superiority. 'Look how much I do and how little I get back.' That's using helping as currency for recognition and getting angry when the payment doesn't arrive."

      "content": "Maybe someone else. Maybe things don't get done. Maybe people figure it out themselves. But 'someone has to' is justification for continuing the pattern that's making you resentful.

You can help when you genuinely want to help and decline when you don't. That's healthy boundaries. But you're saying yes while seething, keeping track of everyone's ingratitude, and using your sacrifice as evidence of how much better you are than them. That's not helping anyone - it's poisoning relationships with hidden resentment.

If you truly were helping from care rather than from need for recognition, you could do things without needing them acknowledged. You could decline requests without feeling selfish. You'd be free to help or not help based on actual capacity and genuine care, not on maintaining your image as the one who sacrifices everything. That freedom is what you're actually avoiding."
