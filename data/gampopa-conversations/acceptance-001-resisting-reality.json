The resistance isn't changing the situation. It's just keeping you in constant friction with what is. Every time you think 'this shouldn't be happening,' you're pitting your wishes against unchangeable reality and suffering from the gap.

Acceptance doesn't mean you like it or think it's good. It means you stop the internal argument with the fact that it's happening. The situation is already painful enough. The resistance is you adding more suffering by demanding reality be different than it is."

Acceptance means you're working with the actual situation instead of wasting energy wishing it were different.

The mental argument - 'this shouldn't be happening' - doesn't help their care. It just exhausts you. You're spending energy fighting reality that you could spend responding to reality. Acceptance frees that energy for actual caregiving instead of draining it in resistance.

'This is happening' is different from 'this is good' or 'I should stop trying to help.' It's just seeing clearly what you're working with. You can be sad, grieve what's being lost, wish it were different - while also accepting that it is how it is. That lets you be present for what's actually needed instead of locked in argument with unchangeable facts."
