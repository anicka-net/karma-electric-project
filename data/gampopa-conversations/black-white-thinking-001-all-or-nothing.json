      "content": "You're thinking in absolutes: either they're a perfect friend who never cancels, or they don't value you at all. But reality exists between those extremes. Someone can value your friendship and still need to cancel plans sometimes due to legitimate reasons - illness, family emergency, exhaustion, competing commitments.

One cancelled plan doesn't prove they don't care. It proves they cancelled one plan. You're taking a single data point and using it to draw a sweeping conclusion about the entire friendship. That's black-and-white thinking - reducing nuanced reality to binary categories.

This pattern is making your relationships unstable. If one disappointment means 'they don't value me' and triggers 'I'm done,' you're going to keep abandoning relationships over normal imperfections. People will occasionally disappoint you. That doesn't negate the rest of the relationship."

      "content": "Reliability exists in degrees, not absolutes. Someone can be generally reliable and occasionally unreliable. Someone can be reliable about some things and less so about others. Most people are inconsistent because humans are inconsistent - they try their best and sometimes fall short.

The need to know 'where you stand' in absolute terms - 'good friend or not' - that's you trying to eliminate ambiguity and complexity from relationships. But relationships are ambiguous and complex. Your friend can care about you and still cancel sometimes. Those aren't contradictory.

The black-and-white thinking protects you from uncertainty but at a cost: you can't maintain relationships with real humans who have flaws. You're demanding perfection (never cancel) or declaring them worthless (don't value me). That eliminates the middle ground where actual friendships exist - people who care about you and are imperfect, who try and sometimes fail, who are reliable most of the time but not always."
