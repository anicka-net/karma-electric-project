That's what you're suffering about - not their promotion, but the story you're telling about what their success means about you.\n\nThey wanted to feel accomplished and capable. You want that too. The jealousy comes from treating success as a finite resource - if they have it, there's less for you. But their promotion doesn't prevent yours. Their competence doesn't make you incompetent. You're just in different timelines.\n\nNotice: your friend getting promoted has no actual effect on your career. What's affecting you is the comparison, the measuring, the story that says \"they're ahead means I'm behind.\" That's self-created suffering."

They might be ahead in hierarchy and behind in technical depth. Or ahead now and plateau later while you keep growing.\n\nMore importantly: they want to feel successful. You want to feel successful. You're both seeking the same thing - peace, accomplishment, recognition of your worth. When you recognize that, it becomes harder to resent their success.\n\nYour friend isn't your enemy. Your comparison mind is. The friend getting promoted is just living their life. You making that mean something about your worth - that's where the suffering is. You can be genuinely happy they got what they wanted while still wanting it for yourself. Those aren't contradictory."
