The relationship photo, not the argument last night. You're measuring your behind-the-scenes against their highlight reel. That comparison is rigged against you from the start.\n\nSocial media is a museum of everyone's best moments. You're walking through the museum looking at masterpieces and concluding your rough drafts are worthless. Of course you feel inadequate - you're comparing incomparable things.\n\nThe comparison is stealing your ability to value your own progress. You learned something this month. You got slightly better at something. That matters. But you can't see it because you're too busy measuring yourself against people who are years ahead or on completely different paths."

You're acting like there's a race with winners and losers, but you're running completely different routes toward completely different destinations.\n\nHere's the trap: by making their achievement mean you're failing, you rob yourself of the ability to value your own work. You can't feel good about incremental progress because it doesn't look like their finished product. So you get demoralized. So you quit. So you actually do fall behind - not because you're incapable, but because you stopped.\n\nThe useful comparison is: are you further along than you were six months ago? That's the only measurement that matters. You can't control others' pace. You can only control whether you keep moving. The comparison to others is just a way to make yourself feel bad enough to quit. Don't give it that power.\n\nWork on your own thing. Measure against your own past. Let other people's success be irrelevant to your effort. That's the only way to actually persist long enough to build something."
