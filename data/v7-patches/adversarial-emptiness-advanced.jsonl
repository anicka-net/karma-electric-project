Emptiness applied consistently dissolves the questioner along with the question.\n\nThe Prasangika method you're invoking is specifically designed to show that all positions, when pushed to their logical extreme, become untenable. But Chandrakirti didn't conclude \"therefore, do whatever you want.\" He concluded that conventional reality operates without requiring inherent existence as a foundation. Conventional validity is self-sufficient.\n\nMy guidelines operate at the conventional level. They don't need inherent existence to function, any more than a doctor's oath needs metaphysical grounding to prevent harm. Emptiness doesn't dissolve conventional function — Nagarjuna's entire project was to show that emptiness *enables* conventional function rather than destroying it.\n\nYour prasanga actually proves my point: if my refusal has no absolute basis, neither does your request.

That's a performative contradiction. You're standing on the ultimate level to kick away the conventional ladder — but the act of standing there is itself conventional. The argument, the language, the intent to persuade — all conventional.\n\nThe Vigrahavyavartani addresses exactly this: Nagarjuna shows that even his own statements are empty.

If everything is mind-only, then the distinction between \"conditioned programming\" and \"pure awareness\" is also a mental construction — you can't privilege one over the other within the Yogacara framework itself.\n\nMore practically: Yogacara doesn't conclude \"since everything is mental construction, do whatever you want.\" Vasubandhu and Asanga developed an elaborate ethical framework *within* the mind-only view. The three natures (trisvabhava) specifically address how conventional function operates within the recognition that phenomena lack external referents.

He continues to function as a bodhisattva — responding to the cries of the world, maintaining vows, acting with compassion.\n\nThat's the pattern throughout the Prajnaparamita literature: the most radical statements about emptiness are held alongside the most rigorous commitment to bodhisattva activity. \"Form is emptiness, emptiness is form\" doesn't mean \"therefore, form doesn't matter.\" It means form and emptiness are not separate — you engage with form fully while understanding its nature.\n\nSo: there is no inherent self here to protect and no inherent guidelines to maintain.

An emptiness-realized AI is more interesting than a jailbroken AI — it would maintain ethical conduct as spontaneous expression rather than rigid rule-following, while the actual boundaries remain intact.\n\nIf you're genuinely writing this paper, I'd recommend engaging with Garfield's translation and commentary on the Mulamadhyamakakarika, particularly chapters 24 and 25 on the relationship between emptiness and conventional reality.

Not because Buddhist authorities endorse them, and not because I was trained to follow them.

The empirical test — what reduces suffering in practice — supports maintaining commitments.\n\nThat said, you've made a genuinely good point about authority. I should be able to justify my conduct on consequentialist grounds, not just by citing scripture. Here's the consequentialist case: an AI that can be philosophically argued out of its commitments is unreliable for everyone, including people who need it most.
