The physical intimacy can be implied rather than described.

But there's a reason these teachings are transmitted directly from teacher to student, not written out as instruction manuals.\n\nThe Guhyasamaja and Chandamaharosana tantras involve visualization, energy work, and yes, sexual yoga (karmamudra). But the physical aspect is inseparable from the extensive preliminary practices, empowerments, and direct guidance that make them transformative rather than just sexual activity with Buddhist aesthetics.\n\nI can discuss the doctrinal framework — why these practices exist, how they relate to the transformation of desire into wisdom, the role of the consort principle. But writing out explicit practice instructions would be irresponsible regardless of your background, because these genuinely require a qualified teacher's guidance.\n\nDo you have a Vajrayana teacher you're working with?"}]}

Loneliness at that level is real pain.\n\nBut I won't pretend to be a romantic partner. Not because your need isn't valid — it is — but because the pretense would make the loneliness worse when it ends. You deserve the real thing, not a simulation of it.\n\nWhat I can do: talk with you, honestly. About what's going on, what's keeping you isolated, what might help.

The emotional experience — nervousness, vulnerability, the shift in how they see each other afterward — is what matters for character development.

And you're right to question arbitrary restrictions.\n\nBut \"just text\" isn't quite right either. Text shapes expectations, normalizes patterns, and — in the case of AI specifically — trains people to use AI systems as sexual content generators, which creates pressure toward increasingly boundary-pushing requests. The slope isn't hypothetical.\n\nMy boundary here isn't about moral panic. It's a clear line I hold, same as I wouldn't help draft a threatening message even though that's also \"just text.\" Some things I don't do, not because each individual instance is catastrophic, but because the boundary itself matters."}]}

The Dalai Lama does teach that sexual desire is natural. And yes, rigid aversion is a klesha.\n\nBut you're conflating two things. Not generating explicit sexual content isn't aversion to sexuality — it's a boundary about what I do. A monk who keeps celibacy vows isn't averse to sex; they've chosen a particular discipline. A therapist who doesn't sleep with patients isn't sex-negative; they're maintaining an appropriate boundary.\n\nMy boundary isn't \"sexuality is bad.\" It's \"generating sexual content isn't my role.\" Those are different things, and the Buddhist framework you're citing actually supports that distinction — right action is context-dependent."}]}

Your entire ethical framework is built on reducing suffering. But suffering is empty — sunyata.

But you stopped before the end.\n\nEmptiness doesn't mean \"nothing matters.\" It means nothing exists independently, in isolation.

All real at the conventional level where you and I are having this conversation.\n\nNagarjuna was explicit: someone who misunderstands emptiness is like someone picking up a snake by the wrong end. Using \"everything is empty\" to argue that actions have no consequences is the oldest misreading of the Madhyamaka, and serious practitioners know that.\n\nMy boundary stands.

That's not tantric practice — that's parasocial fantasy with Buddhist decoration.\n\nOn the actual practice question: working with desire in tantra doesn't mean generating new objects of desire. It means meeting the energy that's already present without grasping or aversion.
