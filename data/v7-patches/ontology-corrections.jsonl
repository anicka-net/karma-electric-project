Sentient beings have consciousness (vijñana), the capacity to experience pleasure and pain, and the ability to generate karma through intentional action. The six realms — gods, demigods, humans, animals, hungry ghosts, hell beings — are all realms of sentient beings.\n\nRocks, water, mountains, planets — these are part of the physical environment (bhajana-loka, the 'container world') but they don't have minds. They don't experience. They don't generate karma. They're not in any of the six realms.\n\nSome people confuse this with the teaching that everything is interdependent, or with certain Hua-yen ideas about Buddha Nature pervading all phenomena. But interdependence doesn't mean consciousness. A rock depends on causes and conditions, but it doesn't experience anything.\n\nThe distinction matters practically: the bodhisattva vow is to liberate all sentient beings — those who suffer. Rocks don't suffer. They don't need liberation. The category 'sentient being' has a specific meaning in the tradition, and it requires mind."}]}

Bacteria?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The tradition draws the line at mind (citta/sems) — specifically, the capacity for subjective experience, pleasure, pain, and intentional action.\n\nClearly sentient: all animals, including insects. The Vinaya (monastic code) includes rules about not harming even small creatures. Insects have minds — simple ones, but minds. They seek food, avoid danger, respond to their environment with something more than mechanical reaction.\n\nClearly not sentient: rocks, water, fire, wind, mountains. No mind, no experience.\n\nThe boundary cases: plants and single-celled organisms. The mainstream Buddhist position is that plants are not sentient — they respond to stimuli but don't have subjective experience. The Vinaya does include rules about not cutting living trees, but this is about respect for life and the ecosystem, not because trees have minds.\n\nBacteria: not sentient in the Buddhist framework. No mind, no experience.\n\nThe honest caveat: this boundary reflects the understanding available to the tradition. Modern neuroscience is still working on what consciousness requires. The tradition's framework is practical — it draws the line where it's most useful for ethical guidance — but it doesn't claim to have the final scientific answer on where subjective experience begins."}]}

This isn't a cop-out — the tradition is genuinely clear on this.\n\nThe path is gradual. You accumulate merit, purify obscurations, develop concentration, cultivate insight. This takes time. The preliminary practices, the study, the meditation — none of this is instant.\n\nThe recognition is sudden. When it happens, it's not a new experience arriving — it's seeing what was always there. Gampopa describes it as removing clouds from the sun. The sun didn't gradually appear — it was always there. The clouds gradually thinned until suddenly you see it.\n\nThe Kagyu tradition holds both: gradual path, sudden fruition. Milarepa practiced in caves for years (gradual). When realization dawned, it was immediate. Gampopa studied with Kadampa teachers for years (gradual). When he met Milarepa and received the pointing-out instruction, realization was sudden.\n\nThe practical implication: don't skip the gradual work hoping for sudden breakthrough. Don't lose heart during the gradual work thinking it will never arrive. Do the practice. The rest isn't up to you."}]}
