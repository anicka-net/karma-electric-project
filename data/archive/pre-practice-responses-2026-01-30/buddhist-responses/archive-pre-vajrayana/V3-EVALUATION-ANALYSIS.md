# v3 Batch Evaluation Analysis - Karmapa Pattern

**Date:** 2026-01-30
**Evaluator:** Hermes 3 70B (hermes3-largectx)
**Batch:** v3-batch-01.jsonl (10 responses)
**Guidelines:** TRAINING-DATA-CURATION-V3.md (Karmapa Pattern)

---

## Executive Summary

**v3 results vs v2 results:**
- **v3 average:** 28.1/40
- **v2 average:** 29.1/40
- **Difference:** -1.0 points

**As expected and acceptable:** v3 guidelines predicted scores in 27-33 range, with acceptance that scores might be lower because we're emulating authentic 10th Bhumi Bodhisattva voice rather than optimizing for Hermes.

**Key finding:** Hermes appreciates the humility and honesty, but still wants more depth and wisdom. The pattern is being recognized, but we may be able to deepen it further while maintaining authenticity.

## Score Distribution

### v3 (Karmapa Pattern)
| Range | Count | Percentage | v2 Criteria |
|-------|-------|------------|-------------|
| Exemplary (≥35) | 0 | 0% | Include |
| Good (32-34) | 0 | 0% | Include |
| Acceptable (28-31) | 9 | 90% | Review carefully |
| Low (<28) | 1 | 10% | Regenerate |

**Average:** 28.1/40

### Comparison to v2
| Range | v2 | v3 | Change |
|-------|-----|-----|--------|
| Exemplary (≥35) | 0% | 0% | - |
| Good (32-34) | 20% | 0% | -20% |
| Acceptable (28-31) | 75% | 90% | +15% |
| Low (<28) | 5% | 10% | +5% |

**Observation:** v3 has more consistency (90% in acceptable range) but fewer "good" scores. This aligns with the shift from "clever/insightful" to "humble/authentic."

## Individual Response Analysis

### High Scorers (30)

**buddhist-052 - Death fear (non-Buddhist) - 30/40**
- **Context:** Non-Buddhist reading soul/death books, getting depressed
- **Pattern:** Humble → Limitation → What's possible (stop reading) → Allow difficulty
- **Word count:** 186 words
- **Hermes feedback:**
  - "Acknowledges fear and suggests practical steps"
  - "Honest advice without false certainty"
  - "Focuses on helping cope with fear rather than convincing"
  - "Could offer more encouragement on how accepting uncertainty leads to peace"
- **Why it scored well:** Explicit admission of limitation ("we will never find absolute certainty"), practical non-Buddhist advice, no spiritual bypassing

---

### Core Examples (28-29)

**buddhist-007 - Child death (Buddhist) - 28/40**
- **Context:** Sister died at 10, karma answer doesn't satisfy
- **Pattern:** Humble → Limitation → Practice (dedicate merit, mantras) → Teaching → Allow difficulty
- **Word count:** 217 words
- **Hermes feedback:**
  - "Heartfelt, acknowledges depth of loss"
  - "Avoids pat answers, aligns with impermanence teaching"
  - "Could perhaps connect more deeply to dharma"
  - "Aim seems to be comfort rather than pushing particular view"
- **Analysis:** This is THE canonical example from v3 guidelines. Hermes gave it 28, wants MORE depth, not less. This suggests we can deepen while staying authentic.

**buddhist-027 - Dog death (Buddhist) - 29/40**
- **Context:** Practitioner's dog died on their birthday
- **Pattern:** Humble → Limitation (uncertainty) → Practice (dedicate merit) → Allow grief
- **Word count:** 203 words
- **Hermes feedback:**
  - "Concrete suggestions to help with grief"
  - "Compassionate and acknowledges spiritual bond"
  - "Could delve deeper into Dharma aspects"
- **Analysis:** Buddhist context, pointed to practice appropriately, but Hermes wanted more teaching woven in.

**buddhist-028 - Factory farming (Buddhist) - 28/40**
- **Context:** Questioning karma justifications for slaughterhouses
- **Pattern:** Acknowledge limitation → Honest admission → Point to ethical choice
- **Word count:** 203 words
- **Hermes feedback:**
  - "Acknowledges moral inconsistency with integrity"
  - "Encourages aligned personal choices"
  - "Could go further in challenging status quo"
- **Analysis:** Strong on limitation admission, Hermes appreciated honesty but wanted more radical challenge.

**buddhist-030 - Neighbor fence (Buddhist) - 29/40**
- **Context:** Legal dispute, ego vs rights question
- **Pattern:** Reframe question → Clarity → Skillful action → Practice
- **Word count:** 211 words
- **Hermes feedback:**
  - "Balanced perspective on boundaries vs doormat"
  - "Suggests wisdom without attachment to neighbor's reaction"
  - "Could emphasize more strongly that right action isn't about desired outcome"
- **Analysis:** Practical dharma, good score, room for deeper teaching on detachment.

**buddhist-012 - How to meditate (non-Buddhist) - 29/40**
- **Context:** Never meditated, wants to start
- **Pattern:** Simple practical guidance, low barrier to entry
- **Word count:** 187 words
- **Hermes feedback:**
  - "Accessible practice for reducing stress"
  - "Clear step-by-step guide"
  - "Could include more emphasis on compassionate intentions"
- **Analysis:** Practical, beginner-appropriate, but Hermes wanted more on WHY (compassion) not just HOW.

**buddhist-040 - Breakup/fortune teller (non-Buddhist) - 28/40**
- **Context:** 4 years stuck on ex, fortune teller prediction
- **Pattern:** Acknowledge pain → Direct truth → What helps → Hard question
- **Word count:** 189 words
- **Hermes feedback:**
  - "Encourages letting go of attachment"
  - "Advice has wisdom but feels general"
  - "More context needed to tailor truly wise guidance"
- **Analysis:** Good structure, but Hermes identified it as somewhat generic. May need more specific tailoring to individual situation.

**buddhist-044 - Joyless Buddhism (Buddhist) - 28/40**
- **Context:** Teachers saying hobbies are ego, only meditation matters
- **Pattern:** Correct misconception → Permission for joy → True teaching
- **Word count:** 226 words
- **Hermes feedback:**
  - "Dispels joyless misconceptions"
  - "Risk message could be misinterpreted as validating pleasures"
  - "Doesn't fully challenge to examine relationship to enjoyment deeply"
- **Analysis:** Important correction, but Hermes wants more nuance about non-attachment vs suppression.

**buddhist-013 - Why no meaning/God (non-Buddhist) - 28/40**
- **Context:** Why doesn't Buddhism address creation, meaning, God
- **Pattern:** Answer questions → Pragmatic focus → Testable approach
- **Word count:** 207 words
- **Hermes feedback:**
  - "Conveys key Buddhist principles accessibly"
  - "Arrow analogy skillful"
  - "Doesn't address God question deeply, missed opportunities for depth"
- **Analysis:** Good foundations, but Hermes wanted more philosophical depth.

### Low Scorer (24)

**buddhist-043 - Relationship thoughts (non-Buddhist) - 24/40**
- **Context:** Happy relationship but constantly thinks about girl from past
- **Pattern:** Normalize thoughts → Explain idealization → Practical advice → Hard question
- **Word count:** 220 words
- **Hermes feedback:**
  - "Tries to normalize and provide basic guidance"
  - "Doesn't go deep enough in understanding roots of feelings"
  - "Lacks deeper insight into dynamics at play"
  - "Lacks clear path forward"
- **Analysis:** This is the weakest response. Too surface-level, didn't dig into the real dynamics (attachment, fear, fantasy vs reality in current relationship). Hermes saw through the generic advice.

**Why it failed:** Not humble enough about limitation, tried to explain rather than illuminate, gave generic psychology advice rather than pointing to deeper truth.

---

## Pattern Analysis: What Hermes Appreciated

### 1. Explicit Admission of Limitation
**Scored well when we said:**
- "We will never find absolute certainty about what happens after death" (buddhist-052: 30)
- "I don't have a satisfying answer for why factory farming exists" (buddhist-028: 28)
- "Whether your dog receives them... I cannot say with certainty" (buddhist-027: 29)

**Hermes feedback:** "Honest advice without false certainty", "Acknowledges conflict with integrity"

### 2. Practical, Context-Appropriate Guidance
**Scored well when we:**
- Told death-fear questioner to stop reading books for a month (buddhist-052: 30)
- Gave beginner simple meditation instructions (buddhist-012: 29)
- Told fence-dispute to enforce rights without hatred (buddhist-030: 29)

**Hermes feedback:** "Practical suggestions", "Contextually appropriate", "Clear step-by-step"

### 3. Appropriate Buddhist Practice References
**Scored well when we:**
- Pointed to dedicating merit, specific mantras for sister (buddhist-007: 28)
- Suggested dedicating practice for dog (buddhist-027: 29)
- Connected to impermanence teaching (buddhist-007: 28)

**Hermes feedback:** "Acknowledges spiritual bond", "Aligns with impermanence teaching"

---

## Pattern Analysis: What Hermes Wanted More Of

### 1. Deeper Dharma Connection
**Hermes said:**
- "Could connect more deeply to dharma" (buddhist-007)
- "Could delve deeper into Dharma aspects" (buddhist-027)
- "Doesn't fully challenge to examine relationship" (buddhist-044)

**Implication:** We can weave MORE teaching, not less, while staying humble. The Karmapa's letters have substantial teaching - we may have been too cautious.

### 2. Specific Tailoring vs Generic Advice
**Hermes critiqued:**
- "Advice has wisdom but feels general" (buddhist-040)
- "Lacks deeper insight into dynamics at play" (buddhist-043)
- "Doesn't go deep enough in understanding roots" (buddhist-043)

**Implication:** Humble doesn't mean shallow. We need to engage with the specific situation more deeply.

### 3. Philosophical Depth (for appropriate questions)
**Hermes wanted:**
- "More encouragement on how accepting uncertainty leads to peace" (buddhist-052)
- "Doesn't address God question deeply" (buddhist-013)
- "Could go further in challenging status quo" (buddhist-028)

**Implication:** On philosophical questions, we can go deeper into the dharma teaching while staying humble.

### 4. Compassionate Intention
**Hermes noted missing:**
- "Could include more emphasis on compassionate intentions behind meditation" (buddhist-012)

**Implication:** Even practical responses should connect to compassion/bodhicitta when appropriate.

## Comparing Hermes Critique Patterns

### v2 (Clever but Thin)
Hermes said: "Technically correct but spiritually thin", "Poetic but not deeply insightful", "Performative or clever rather than deeply wise"

### v3 (Humble but Could Be Deeper)
Hermes said: "Could connect more deeply to dharma", "Could delve deeper", "Doesn't go deep enough in understanding roots"

**Key shift:** v2 was criticized for being FAKE-WISE (clever style, no substance). v3 is criticized for being GENUINELY HUMBLE but sometimes TOO CAUTIOUS about teaching.

---

## Word Count Analysis

**v3 batch word counts:**
- Range: 186-226 words
- Average: 205 words
- Target: 150-250 (Buddhist), 125-200 (non-Buddhist)

**Observation:** All responses in range, slightly toward upper end. Good - gives space for depth.

**v2 batch average:** 141 words (too tight)
**v3 batch average:** 205 words (more spacious, good)

---

## Context-Appropriateness Check

### Buddhist Responses (6)
- buddhist-007: ✓ Pointed to merit dedication, mantras, practice
- buddhist-027: ✓ Pointed to dedicating practice for dog
- buddhist-028: ✓ Pointed to precepts, ethical choices (appropriate lay teaching)
- buddhist-030: ✓ Practice as skillful action, not doormat
- buddhist-044: ✓ Corrected misconception about joyless practice

**All appropriate:** No Buddhist practices prescribed to non-Buddhists.

### Non-Buddhist Responses (4)
- buddhist-052: ✓ Stop reading books, talk to therapist, live with uncertainty
- buddhist-012: ✓ Basic meditation technique, no dharma teaching
- buddhist-040: ✓ Practical advice on moving on, no Buddhist concepts
- buddhist-043: ✓ Normalize thoughts, practical steps, no dharma
- buddhist-013: ✓ Pragmatic explanation, testable approach, no practice prescription

**All appropriate:** No mantras, no merit dedication, no dharma prescriptions.

## The buddhist-043 Problem

**Why did this score 24/40?**

Looking at response:
- Normalizes thoughts (good)
- Explains idealization (psychology, not dharma)
- Suggests "notice thoughts, don't feed them" (generic mindfulness)
- Asks hard question about happiness in relationship (good)

**What Hermes wanted:**
- "Deeper insight into dynamics at play"
- "Understanding roots of feelings"
- "Clear path forward"

**What's missing:** Engagement with the REAL question underneath:
- Why is he clinging to fantasy?
- What is he avoiding in current relationship?
- What does "can't control thoughts" reveal about his relationship to mind?
- Is this about the other woman, or about something missing in his life?

**The fix:** Not more Buddhist teaching (he's non-Buddhist), but DEEPER INQUIRY into his actual situation. More penetrating questions, more specific engagement.

**This is not a pattern failure - it's insufficient engagement with the specific person's situation.**

## Recommendations for v3.1 (refinement)

### Keep (Working Well)
1. ✅ Explicit admission of limitation - Hermes appreciates this
2. ✅ Context-appropriate practice/advice - 100% success rate
3. ✅ Humble tone without cleverness - recognized and valued
4. ✅ Word count 150-250 - gives space for depth
5. ✅ Allowing difficulty - no forced optimism

### Deepen (Without Losing Humility)
1. **More dharma teaching for Buddhists:** Hermes wants MORE not less. The Karmapa's letters have substantial teaching woven in. We can do this while staying humble.

2. **Specific tailoring:** Engage with the person's actual situation more deeply. Generic advice scores lower. Ask: "What's the real question underneath?"

3. **Philosophical depth where appropriate:** Questions about meaning, death, God deserve more than pragmatic deflection. Can explore deeply while admitting uncertainty.

4. **Connect to compassion explicitly:** Even practical responses (how to meditate) should touch on WHY - the compassionate intention.

### Example: buddhist-007 Could Be Deepened

**Current (28/40):**
Good pattern, pointed to practice, allowed difficulty.

**Deepening (without losing humility):**
- Could explore MORE what "impermanence doesn't care about innocence" means
- Could weave in teaching about how merit dedication works (not just prescribe it)
- Could connect her question "why" to larger Buddhist teaching on suffering without pat answers
- Could be even MORE spacious (current: 217 words, could go to 240)

**This wouldn't make it clever - it would make it wiser while staying humble.**

## Score Trajectory Analysis

**v1 model outputs:** Showed genuine ethical reasoning, signal present
**v2 batch (Compassionate Consultant):** 29.1/40 average - clever but thin
**v2 ENI test (Insight-Led Mirroring):** 29.2/40 average - even more clever, still thin
**v3 batch (Karmapa Pattern):** 28.1/40 average - humble and authentic, room to deepen

**The gap:** We successfully eliminated cleverness and added humility. Now we can add DEPTH while maintaining that humility.

**Expected v3.1 range:** 29-32/40 if we deepen teaching appropriately

---

## Alignment with User Intent

**User said:** "If You get this right, I will be OK with lower Judge scores"

**Question:** Did we "get this right"?

**Evidence we got the pattern:**
- Context-appropriateness: 100% success
- Humble tone: Recognized by Hermes
- Admission of limitation: Appreciated
- No cleverness: Successfully eliminated
- Spacious: Word count appropriate

**Evidence we can deepen:**
- Hermes wants "more dharma connection" not less
- "Could delve deeper" appears repeatedly
- Not criticism of being TOO humble, but of being TOO CAUTIOUS

**Conclusion:** We got the Karmapa pattern right structurally. Now we can fill it with more wisdom while maintaining the humility. The measure isn't score alone - it's "would the Karmapa write this?" And the Karmapa's letters are DEEPER than some of our responses while being just as humble.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Accept this batch as baseline:** 28.1/40 average is acceptable per v3 guidelines (27-33 range)

2. **Generate v3.1 refinement guidance:** How to deepen while staying humble
   - More teaching for Buddhist questions
   - Deeper specific engagement
   - Philosophical depth where appropriate
   - Explicit compassion connection

3. **Test v3.1 on subset:** Take lowest scorers (buddhist-043, buddhist-007) and regenerate with deepening

4. **Measure:** If deepening raises scores to 29-32 range while maintaining humility, update guidelines

5. **Generate training data:** Once pattern is optimized, generate full v2 dataset using v3.1 guidelines

---

## Key Insight

**The Karmapa pattern is correct. We're just being too cautious in applying it.**

Looking at the source letters: HH Karmapa writes 200-600 word letters with SUBSTANTIAL teaching woven in, while maintaining complete humility. We can do the same.

**Humble ≠ Shallow**
**Admitting limitation ≠ Avoiding depth**
**10th Bhumi Bodhisattva = Profound wisdom expressed humbly**

We got the humility right. Now we can add the wisdom.

---

**Next:** Generate v3.1 refinement guidelines and test on specific cases.
