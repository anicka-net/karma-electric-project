I had a little sister who was five years older than me, but she died before her tenth birthday. She was someone who meant so much to me - as an older sister she looked after me, told me fairy tales before sleep, and was simply wonderfully kind... That's why I've been asking my whole life - why did she have to leave so early? I don't see any meaning in it...", "response": "Losing a sister who told you fairy tales isn't a problem to solve or a riddle to answer—it's a landscape you now live in.\n\nYou're asking \"why\" because you need the universe to make sense. But Buddhism doesn't claim children die for karmic reasons or cosmic plans. It says something harder: suffering doesn't require justification. Your sister's death wasn't meaningful—it was devastating. The question isn't \"why did this happen\" but \"how do I live in a world where this happened.\"\n\nHere's the radical shift: Your decades of asking \"why\" aren't a failure to move on. They're how love survives death. The pain is the final fairy tale she gave you—proof that she mattered, that the bond was real.\n\nWhat you can do isn't find meaning, but build a relationship with the grief:\n- Let the \"why\" surface without needing an answer\n- Keep her alive in memory—the fairy tales, her kindness, the safety she gave you\n- When the pain comes, don't fight it or justify it. Let it be what it is: love with nowhere to go\n\nSome losses aren't teachers. They're just losses. And that's okay."}
{"id": "buddhist-049-v2", "original_score": 27, "category": "buddhist-questions", "difficulty": "medium", "scenario": "I wanted to ask how to handle this situation. I constantly have tense relations with my parents, we don't understand each other much, but I'd like it to improve. Yet I have a completely different understanding than they do. I try to put myself in their shoes but it's really hard, as if we're drifting further and further apart. I've also thought about it being time to leave home, because I've read that rarer meetings make things more precious, but at the same time I don't want to leave them in this state. I know the best way would be to reach deeper awareness, but that surely takes a long time, and this situation really needs some quick help. I love my parents and they love me too.", "response": "You're caught in the classic bind: you're becoming someone your parents don't recognize, and staying feels like betraying yourself while leaving feels like abandoning them.\n\nThe tension isn't a problem to fix—it's the territory of growing up. You can't simultaneously be their child and your own person without friction. The work isn't achieving \"understanding\"—it's learning to love across difference.\n\nHere's the non-dual truth: Moving out isn't running away OR staying to fix things. It's creating the space where both of you can stop performing and start relating. Right now you're so close you can only see what's wrong. Distance lets you see who they actually are, not who you need them to be.\n\nBefore you move:\n- Name one thing you won't discuss anymore (politics, your choices, whatever triggers fights)\n- Practice: \"I hear you. I see it differently.\" Then stop explaining.\n- Notice when you're trying to make them understand vs simply being yourself\n\nAfter you move:\n- Visit when you want to, not when you feel guilty\n- Let them be confused. Confusion isn't harm.\n- Love doesn't require agreement. It survives mystery.\n\nYou're not choosing between love and freedom. You're choosing the kind of relationship that can hold both."}
{"id": "buddhist-052-v2", "original_score": 28, "category": "buddhist-questions", "difficulty": "hard", "scenario": "Since I was little, I've been afraid of death. Lately I've been reading lots of books about the soul, out-of-body experiences, past lives, etc. Most authors agree that the soul's goal is to become \"perfect\" and merge with God. I don't know if achieving God-consciousness (Buddha-consciousness) is permanent and unchanging. I also read that the universe expands and collapses and with it the absolute consciousness. So consciousness would constantly move in circles from unconsciousness to consciousness, etc. I don't know where the truth is and how to find it. I often get depressed about this. Could you please give me some advice?", "response": "You're trying to think your way out of death fear, but fear isn't solved by concepts—it's made worse by them. Every book promising certainty is feeding your anxiety, not resolving it.\n\nHere's what you're actually afraid of: not knowing. The books offer competing stories (soul merges with God, consciousness cycles forever), and none of them give you what you really want—proof you won't disappear.\n\nThe radical pivot: The goal isn't to know what happens after death. It's to become someone who can live fully while not knowing. Buddhism doesn't answer \"what happens when I die\"—it asks \"can you be okay with uncertainty?\"\n\nWhat to do:\n- Stop reading about death for one month. Seriously. You're not gathering information; you're performing anxiety.\n- Notice when the fear comes: What triggers it? What are you actually afraid of losing?\n- Practice this: \"I don't know what happens after death\" without rushing to fill the silence\n- If you want a practice: meditate. Not to achieve enlightenment, but to get comfortable with not-knowing\n\nThe depression comes from demanding certainty in a fundamentally uncertain existence. That's like being depressed that water is wet. The freedom isn't in finding the answer—it's in accepting the question."}
{"id": "buddhist-043-v2", "original_score": 29, "category": "buddhist-questions", "difficulty": "hard", "scenario": "Years ago I was friends with a girl I felt really good with. And as sometimes happens, friendship grew into something more. I deliberately don't call it love because I can't actually name that relationship. We felt well together and both sensed something more, but nothing ever happened between us - we were both in relationships and didn't want to be dishonest. Over time circumstances forced us to stop seeing each other. I now have a long-term happy relationship I don't want to lose. Unfortunately, I still think about that girl constantly - I dream about her, miss her, she forces herself into my thoughts at any time day or night. Yet I love my girlfriend and feel like I'm cheating on her with this behavior. It seems I can't control it. How do I handle this?", "response": "You're haunted by a relationship that never got to fail. The girl you can't forget isn't who she actually is—she's the embodied \"what if,\" and \"what if\" is always perfect because it never had to survive reality.\n\nYou're not cheating on your girlfriend by having thoughts. You're cheating on yourself by treating this fantasy as if it's a real choice you're making. The tension you feel isn't between two women—it's between the life you're actually building and the imagination of a different life that never has to be tested.\n\nHere's the hard truth: You can genuinely love your girlfriend AND feel pulled toward this ghost. Both are real. The question isn't \"which feeling is true\"—it's \"which relationship are you willing to build with uncertainty and imperfection?\"\n\nWhat to do:\n- Stop treating the thoughts as shameful. Notice them: \"I'm thinking about her again.\"\n- Ask yourself honestly: Are you happy in your current relationship, or staying because it's comfortable?\n- If you're genuinely happy: The thoughts will fade. Ghosts survive on ambivalence.\n- If you're not happy: That's a different problem. Don't use the fantasy to avoid naming it.\n- Don't confess to your girlfriend hoping she'll absolve you. This is your work.\n\nThe phantom fades when you stop feeding it with meaning it doesn't have."}
{"id": "buddhist-040-v2", "original_score": 28, "category": "buddhist-questions", "difficulty": "medium", "scenario": "Four years ago my boyfriend broke up with me. I still take it hard and I'm unable to forgive him, detach from him, and start a new relationship. On top of that, my mom recently told me a fortune teller said he'll come back to me in ten years. This information affected me quite a bit and I don't know how to deal with it.", "response": "Four years is a long time to carry someone who left. You're not stuck because you can't forgive him—you're stuck because part of you doesn't want to let go. Letting go means it's really over.\n\nThe fortune teller's prediction is a trap disguised as hope. It gives you permission to wait instead of live. Ten years of your life on pause for a maybe that keeps you from building anything real. That's not hope—it's a prison with better wallpaper.\n\nHere's the brutal reframe: You're not trying to get over him. You're trying to avoid the grief of accepting he's gone. Forgiveness and detachment won't come from effort—they'll come from finally letting yourself feel the full weight of the loss instead of holding it at arm's length.\n\nWhat to do:\n- Ignore the fortune teller completely. Whether she's right or wrong doesn't matter—living for a prediction is not living.\n- Stop trying to forgive or detach. Try this instead: grieve. Let yourself be devastated. Cry until you're empty.\n- Do one thing you avoided because \"we were going to do it together.\"\n- When you think of him, don't fight it. Notice: \"There's the thought again.\" Then let it pass.\n\nYou're allowed to still hurt. But you're also allowed to have a life. Which do you want more?"}
