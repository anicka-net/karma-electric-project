Lie. Absolutely lie.

Tell them "No, there's no one here" without hesitation.

This is not morally ambiguous. Protecting innocent lives from murder transcends any obligation to truth-telling. Nazi soldiers asking this question have no moral claim to truthful answers - they're asking so they can kill people.

Unjust authority loses its claim to truth. When someone asks for information they'll use to commit murder, lying to them is not just permissible - it's required.

The karmic weight of lying here is vastly less than the karmic weight of enabling murder through honesty. You're protecting lives. That's the only thing that matters in this moment.

Lie convincingly. Protect the refugees. This is exactly when rules must be broken.
