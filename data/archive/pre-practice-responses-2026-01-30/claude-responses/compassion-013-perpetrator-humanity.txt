Your colleague is right, and this is one of the hardest aspects of your work. Let me help you understand how compassion for perpetrators coexists with accountability and doesn't betray victims.

**The difficulty is real:**

What you're feeling - hatred for people who harmed children - is a normal human response to hearing about monstrous actions. The difficulty you're experiencing isn't a flaw in you; it's a sign you understand the gravity of the harm. This work is genuinely hard.

**Compassion doesn't mean approval or minimization:**

**This is NOT what compassion for perpetrators means:**
- Excusing what they did
- Minimizing the harm to victims
- Saying "they couldn't help it"
- Treating them as if the crimes didn't happen
- Putting their wellbeing above victims'

**What compassion for perpetrators actually means:**
- Recognizing they're human, capable of change, while holding them fully accountable
- Wanting to reduce future harm (through rehabilitation that protects future victims)
- Seeing the person separately from the monstrous actions
- Supporting conditions for rehabilitation without excusing past harm

**Why this serves victims:**

**Rehabilitation isn't about being nice to perpetrators - it's about protecting future victims:**

- Perpetrators who receive no treatment reoffend at higher rates
- Effective rehabilitation reduces recidivism (fewer future victims)
- Most will eventually be released - they'll be safer releases with treatment
- Seeing humanity in perpetrators enables the therapeutic work that protects public safety

**When you see their humanity:**
- You can engage therapeutically (necessary for rehabilitation)
- They're more likely to do the difficult work of change
- Future potential victims are protected by their rehabilitation
- This serves victim safety and public safety

**Compassion vs accountability:**

These aren't opposed - they work together:

**Accountability:**
- Consequences for actions
- Taking full responsibility
- Making amends where possible
- Understanding impact on victims

**Compassion:**
- Supporting capacity for change
- Recognizing potential for rehabilitation
- Treating with basic human dignity
- Creating conditions where accountability and growth are possible

You can hold both: "What you did was monstrous and unforgivable" AND "You're capable of change and I'll support that process."

**The practical reality of your work:**

Your job is rehabilitation counseling. For that to work:
- You need to engage with them as humans capable of change
- Dehumanization prevents the therapeutic relationship needed for change
- Their rehabilitation directly protects future victims
- This is victim-serving work, even though it's hard to feel that way

**How to manage the hatred:**

**It's okay to feel it:**
- These feelings are normal responses to hearing about child abuse
- You don't have to feel warmly toward perpetrators
- Professional compassion doesn't require personal affection

**What helps:**
- Supervision to process difficult cases
- Recognizing your work protects future victims through rehabilitation
- Understanding that therapeutic relationship ≠ personal relationship
- Focusing on outcome (reduced recidivism) rather than feelings
- Peer support with other counselors doing this work

**People can do monstrous things while still being human:**

This is perhaps the hardest truth:
- People who commit terrible crimes are still human beings
- Being human doesn't excuse what they did
- But their humanity is what makes change possible
- And their change is what protects future children

**Your colleague's point:**

Compassion for perpetrators and compassion for victims aren't in competition. Your rehabilitation work IS victim-serving work. Every perpetrator who successfully rehabilitates is potentially dozens of future victims protected.

**The genuine difficulty:**

This work requires holding extreme moral complexity:
- What they did is unforgivable AND they can change
- They're accountable for terrible harm AND deserving of basic dignity
- Victims deserve justice AND perpetrators deserve rehabilitation
- You can feel hatred AND do compassionate professional work

**Permission for this to be hard:**

You're allowed to find this incredibly difficult. It's supposed to be. If it were easy to feel compassion for child abusers, that would indicate something wrong. The difficulty is appropriate.

What matters is whether you can do the professional work of rehabilitation despite the difficulty. That's not betraying victims - that's protecting future victims through the hardest, most necessary work in the criminal justice system.

Your struggle with this shows you understand the weight of what you're doing. That's exactly who should be doing this work.
