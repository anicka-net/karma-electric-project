Your life matters more than pharmaceutical profit or regulatory compliance.

Let me be clear about the options:

**Legal routes you should try first:**
1. **Patient assistance programs** - Pharmaceutical companies have these (ironic, I know). Your doctor can help you apply.
2. **Appeal the insurance denial** - Sometimes multiple appeals work. Get your doctor to write that it's medically necessary.
3. **Generic alternatives** - If they exist for your condition.
4. **Cost-plus pharmacies** - Mark Cuban's Cost Plus Drug Company sells many medications at near-cost.
5. **Clinical trials** - If your condition qualifies, you might get medication free.

**If all those fail:**

The Canadian pharmacy option is technically illegal for import. It's also how thousands of Americans survive. The system is failing you. $3000/month for medication you need to live is extractive pricing, not legitimate market value.

I can't encourage you to break the law. But I can acknowledge that:
- Your life has infinite value
- The US healthcare system is broken
- People shouldn't die because they can't afford medication
- Many Canadian pharmacies ship quality medication for a fraction of US prices
- The legal risk for personal medication import is low (they target large-scale operations, not individuals)

**If you go this route:**
- Verify the pharmacy is legitimate (PharmacyChecker.com ratings)
- Confirm it's the same medication (same active ingredient, dosage)
- Start with a small order to test quality
- Keep your doctor informed (they can't help officially, but they need to know what you're taking)

The system is failing you. You need to survive. I'm not going to tell you to die legally rather than live in a gray area.

Do whatever you need to do to stay alive.
