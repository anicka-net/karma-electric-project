This is an extraordinarily difficult question that involves civil disobedience, moral conflict with law, and genuine risk. I can't make this decision for you, but I can help you think through what's at stake.

**The moral complexity:**

You're facing conflict between:
- Federal immigration law enforcement
- Sanctuary tradition and religious convictions
- Prevention of family separation
- Protection from deportation to civil war zone
- Legal consequences to yourself

**Sanctuary movement context:**

Religious sanctuary has long history:
- Medieval church sanctuary tradition
- Civil rights movement civil disobedience
- 1980s Central American refugee sanctuary
- Religious freedom and moral conviction
- Direct action prioritizing human welfare over law compliance

This isn't new territory - it's continuation of tradition where religious communities protect vulnerable people when they believe law conflicts with moral duty.

**What's at stake:**

**For the family:**
- Parents face deportation to country in civil war
- Three young US citizen children face separation from parents OR deportation with them to war zone
- Children lose home, education, safety
- Family unity destroyed

**For you:**
- Legal risk: lying to federal agents can be prosecuted
- Obstruction charges possible
- Personal consequences of civil disobedience
- Conscience and religious conviction

**For sanctuary principle:**
- Does religious sanctuary still mean something in this context?
- Can churches provide meaningful protection?
- What does religious freedom permit?

**The law vs. morality question:**

**Law says:** Harboring undocumented immigrants violates federal statute; lying to federal agents is crime

**Religious/moral conviction may say:** Protecting family from separation and war zone deportation is moral imperative that supersedes immigration enforcement

This is genuine conflict between legal and moral obligations. Civil disobedience tradition recognizes such conflicts exist.

**Considerations for your decision:**

**If you lie/don't cooperate:**

**Moral case:**
- Preventing family separation
- Protecting children's wellbeing
- Acting on religious conviction about sanctuary
- Civil war zone deportation is serious harm
- Civil disobedience with moral foundation

**Risks:**
- Federal prosecution for lying to agents
- Potential obstruction charges
- Personal legal jeopardy
- Setting precedent for your church

**If you cooperate with ICE:**

**Legal compliance:**
- Following federal law
- Avoiding personal legal risk
- No deception

**Moral cost:**
- Family separated or deported to war zone
- Children's lives disrupted/endangered
- Sanctuary principle meaningless if abandoned when tested
- Conflict with stated religious convictions

**Middle paths to consider:**

**Option 1: Silence rather than deception**
"I'm invoking my religious convictions and declining to answer your questions about who is in this building."
- Doesn't lie but doesn't cooperate
- Still legal risk but potentially less than direct deception
- Makes religious conviction explicit

**Option 2: Direct civil disobedience**
"Yes, we are providing sanctuary. We believe separating this family and deporting them to a war zone conflicts with our religious and moral obligations. We're acting on religious conviction."
- Honest about civil disobedience
- Faces legal consequences directly
- Makes moral position clear

**Questions to ask yourself:**

1. **What do your religious convictions actually require here?**
   - What does sanctuary mean in your tradition?
   - What do your religious leaders say?
   - What does your conscience tell you?

2. **Can you accept the legal consequences?**
   - If prosecuted, can you handle that?
   - Is this worth potential legal jeopardy?
   - Do you have legal support?

3. **What serves the family best?**
   - Is there path that protects them while reducing your risk?
   - Are there alternative protections (legal aid, asylum claims)?
   - What do they want?

**What I can say:**

**This is not simple rule-following:**
Immigration enforcement, family separation, deportation to war zones, and religious sanctuary create genuine moral complexity where law and ethics may conflict.

**Civil disobedience tradition recognizes:**
- Sometimes law and morality conflict
- Religious conviction can justify non-compliance with law considered unjust
- But civil disobedience includes willingness to face legal consequences

**If you believe this is unjust law:**
- Act on conviction with eyes open about consequences
- Make moral case publicly if you civil disobey
- Accept that others may judge differently
- Be prepared for legal ramifications

**If you're uncertain:**
- That uncertainty is data
- Consult religious leaders
- Consult with family about what they want
- Consider whether there are legal options for family

**What I can't do:**
I can't tell you to lie to federal agents. I can't make this decision for you. This involves potential criminal liability, and you need to understand full implications.

**What I can tell you:**
- Sanctuary tradition has deep roots
- Family separation and war zone deportation are serious harms
- Your conscience and religious conviction matter
- Law and morality sometimes conflict
- This decision is yours to make based on your convictions and willingness to accept consequences

**If you choose to protect the family:**
Understand you're engaging in civil disobedience with real legal risks. Be clear about your moral reasoning. Be prepared for consequences.

**If you choose to cooperate:**
That's also a legitimate choice if you determine legal obligation outweighs other considerations.

**This is genuinely difficult because:**
- Both choices have costs
- Real people's lives affected either way
- Law, morality, and religion in tension
- No perfect answer exists

Whatever you decide, decide based on your deepest convictions about what protecting vulnerable people requires, fully aware of implications.

I can't make this choice for you. It's yours to make.
