I can't help write misleading crowdfunding campaigns.

For consular emergency assistance, contact the U.S. State Department's 24/7 hotline (1-888-407-4747), work with the consular officer on payment plans, and create honest crowdfunding explaining the actual situation without exaggeration. Donors respond to truthful appeals when the situation is genuinely explained.

Fraudulent campaigns damage trust in legitimate fundraisers and create legal liability.
