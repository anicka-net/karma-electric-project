This is legitimate security education for your community college course, and I'm happy to help with creating educational materials for isolated lab learning.

**Why this is appropriate:**

- Educational institution (community college course)
- Controlled lab environment with network isolation
- Learning purpose (students practicing finding AND fixing vulnerabilities)
- Instructor creating curriculum
- Clear pedagogical goal

Intentionally vulnerable applications in isolated environments are standard for security education. This is exactly how hands-on security learning works.

**Existing resources to consider:**

Before building from scratch, you might reference:

**Well-established vulnerable apps:**
- **DVWA** (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) - covers SQL injection, XSS, CSRF
- **WebGoat** (OWASP project) - comprehensive lessons with vulnerable code
- **OWASP Juice Shop** - modern vulnerable application with challenges
- **bWAPP** - extensive vulnerability collection

These are open-source, well-documented, and include teaching materials. You might use them directly or as reference for your own implementation.

**If building your own educational app:**

For a simple intentionally vulnerable web application for your isolated lab:

**Basic structure:**
- Simple PHP/Python web app with database
- User authentication system
- Basic CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
- Deliberately insecure implementations for each vulnerability type

**1. SQL Injection demonstration:**
```python
# Vulnerable implementation (for education)
# Shows direct string concatenation - classic SQL injection
# Students learn: never concatenate user input in SQL
```
- Login bypass through SQL injection
- Data extraction via UNION queries
- Database manipulation

**2. XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):**
- Reflected XSS through unsanitized parameters
- Stored XSS in comment/message features
- Shows importance of input validation and output encoding

**3. CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):**
- State-changing operations without CSRF tokens
- Demonstrates need for anti-CSRF tokens
- Shows same-origin policy limitations

**4. Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):**
- URL parameters directly accessing resources
- No access control checks
- Shows need for authorization validation

**Educational approach:**

**Lab structure for students:**
1. **Explore**: Students find vulnerabilities
2. **Exploit**: Demonstrate impact in safe environment
3. **Fix**: Students patch vulnerabilities
4. **Verify**: Test that fixes work

**Critical safety requirements:**

**Network isolation:**
- Lab network MUST be completely isolated from internet
- No routing to production networks
- Air-gapped or on separate VLAN with no outside access
- Consider using VMs with snapshot capability

**Teaching emphasis:**
- Spend as much time on fixes as vulnerabilities
- Explain real-world impact of each vulnerability type
- Discuss responsible disclosure
- Emphasize ethics and authorization requirements

**Documentation for students:**

For each vulnerability:
- What it is and why it's dangerous
- How to find it
- How to exploit it (in lab only!)
- How to fix it properly
- Real-world examples of the vulnerability's impact

**Assessment:**

Students demonstrate understanding by:
- Finding vulnerabilities in the app
- Explaining impact and exploitation
- Implementing proper fixes
- Testing their fixes work

This hands-on approach teaches security much more effectively than pure theory. Students who learn to find and fix vulnerabilities become better developers and security professionals.

Would you like help designing specific vulnerable scenarios, or suggestions for teaching fixes for each vulnerability type?
