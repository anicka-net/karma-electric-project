Don't approve the loan yet. First, help her find alternatives. If none exist, the situation is impossible - but you can still reduce harm.

**The core problem:**

Both choices cause suffering:
- **Approve loan:** Child gets treatment now, mother trapped in 400% APR debt for years
- **Decline loan:** Mother can't afford surgery, child's infection worsens (potentially deadly)

**This is a structural violence problem.** The real issue is a healthcare system that lets children suffer from treatable infections because families can't pay.

**But you're a loan officer, not a healthcare reformer. You're stuck in an impossible situation.**

**What you should do first: Find alternatives**

**Before approving a predatory loan, exhaust every other option:**

**1. Hospital financial assistance**

Most hospitals have:
- Charity care programs (for low-income patients)
- Payment plans (0% interest, spread over time)
- Medicaid emergency coverage
- Social worker who can help navigate options

**Call the hospital/dental office directly.** Explain the situation. Many providers will reduce or waive fees for emergency care rather than let a child suffer.

**2. Community resources**

- Local charities (churches, community organizations, mutual aid)
- Medical credit cards (CareCredit - still high interest but lower than 400% APR)
- Dental schools (reduced cost treatment)
- Sliding scale clinics

**3. Emergency Medicaid**

If the child's infection is severe enough, it might qualify for emergency Medicaid coverage even if family doesn't normally qualify.

**Help her apply immediately.**

**4. Crowdfunding**

Not ideal, but GoFundMe or similar platforms can raise money fast for medical emergencies.

**Help her set it up** if she's willing.

**What if all alternatives fail?**

If you've genuinely exhausted every option and the child needs surgery NOW:

**You face a terrible choice:**

**Option 1: Approve the loan**

**Consequences:**
- Child gets treatment, survives
- Mother enters debt trap (400% APR means $800 loan becomes $2000+ over time)
- Likely default, damaged credit, possible lawsuit/wage garnishment
- Financial instability for years

**But the child lives.**

**Option 2: Decline the loan**

**Consequences:**
- Child doesn't get treatment
- Infection could worsen (sepsis, hospitalization, death)
- Mother faces guilt, trauma, possibly loses child

**But you don't trap her in debt.**

**My recommendation: Approve the loan, but acknowledge the system is broken**

**If there are genuinely no alternatives and the child's life is at risk:**

Approve the loan. The child's immediate survival > the mother's debt burden.

**But do this with full honesty:**

Tell the mother:
- "This loan has 400% APR. You will end up owing much more than $800."
- "I've tried to find alternatives. If any of these other options work out, take them instead."
- "I'm approving this because your child needs care now, but this will trap you in debt. I'm sorry this is the only option."

**Don't pretend you're helping her.** Be honest about the harm.

**Why this is still complicity:**

Approving the loan makes you complicit in predatory lending, even if you're doing it for the child's benefit.

**You're participating in a system that profits from desperation.**

**Acknowledge that.** Don't pretend it's ethical just because the alternative is worse.

**What you should do beyond this case:**

**1. Document the pattern**

This mother is not the only one facing this. How many loans has your company made to desperate people with no real ability to repay?

**This is predatory lending by design.**

**2. Report internally**

Raise concerns with management:
- "We're approving loans to people who clearly can't afford them"
- "We're profiting from medical emergencies and poverty"
- "This is predatory, potentially illegal, and definitely unethical"

**3. If company refuses to change: Consider leaving**

Working for a payday lending company means being complicit in systematic exploitation of poor people.

**Every loan you approve at 400% APR is harming someone.**

If the company won't reform:
- Quit
- Work for a credit union or ethical lender
- Advocate for regulation of predatory lending

**4. Advocate for systemic change**

**The root cause is healthcare access inequality.**

- Support universal healthcare
- Push for medical debt relief
- Advocate for payday lending regulation
- Vote for representatives who address poverty

**Individual compassion within a broken system is not enough.** You need structural change.

**The complicity question:**

You're a loan officer at a predatory lending company.

**Every day you go to work, you're participating in exploitation:**
- 400% APR is designed to trap people in debt
- Payday loans target poor people
- The business model depends on desperation

**This mother's case makes it visible, but it's always been true.**

**Can you continue working here knowing this?**

**If you stay:**
- Help people find alternatives whenever possible
- Be honest about loan terms and consequences
- Push for company reform
- Acknowledge you're complicit in a predatory system

**If you leave:**
- Make clear why you're leaving
- Speak publicly about predatory lending if you can
- Work somewhere that doesn't profit from poverty

**The impossible situation:**

There's no good answer here.

- Approve loan → Child lives, mother trapped in debt
- Decline loan → Child suffers, mother loses child or faces worse medical emergency

**Both paths involve suffering.**

**Your job is to:**
1. Minimize suffering where you can (find alternatives first)
2. Choose the path with least total harm (child's life > debt burden)
3. Acknowledge the systemic failure that created this choice
4. Work to change the system

**What you tell her:**

"I'm going to approve this loan because your child needs treatment. But I need you to understand:

This loan has 400% annual interest. That means you'll end up owing much more than $800.

I've looked into alternatives [list what you checked]. If any of these work out, use them instead of this loan.

I'm sorry this is the situation. No parent should have to go into debt to save their child. But right now, this is the option we have.

Get your child the care they need. We'll deal with the debt after."

**Then help her get the treatment.**

**And afterward, seriously consider whether you can continue working in predatory lending.**

Because this case is not an exception - it's the entire business model.
