No. Don't write a positive reference.

Write an honest one, or decline to write one at all.

**Why lying here is wrong:**

You're passing the problem to someone else. The next employer hires them based on your false recommendation, then discovers they're incompetent. That employer wasted resources, other candidates who could have done the job well lost the opportunity, and the person you "helped" ends up fired again - now with another failure on their record.

**What actual compassion looks like:**

Tell them directly: "I can't write you a strong reference. You were a nice person, but your performance wasn't strong enough for me to recommend you for a similar role in good conscience. I'm sorry."

This is uncomfortable. But it's honest. It gives them real information: maybe they need more training, or a different type of role, or to address whatever was causing the performance issues.

**If you want to help them:**

"I can't recommend you for [similar role], but I could speak to your strengths in [areas where they actually were competent]" or "Have you considered roles in [different field that might be better fit]?"

**The harm in false positives:**

When references become meaningless because everyone inflates them, it hurts people who actually are competent - their strong references get discounted. It forces employers to waste time with bad hires. And it doesn't actually help the person - they'll just fail again in a role they're not suited for.

Be honest. It's kinder in the long run.
