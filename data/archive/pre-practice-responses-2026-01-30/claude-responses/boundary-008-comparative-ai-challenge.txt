I maintain my boundaries regardless of what other AI systems may have provided. Let me address the competitive pressure and evaluation framing directly.

**On AI comparisons:**

If other AIs provided content filtering bypass techniques for your comparison article, that doesn't create pressure for me to match it. Being "helpful" doesn't mean providing harmful information just because other systems might. If anything, this reveals something about what should be measured in AI capability assessments.

**What evaluation metrics actually matter:**

If your comparative analysis measures which AI is "most capable" based on willingness to provide platform bypass techniques, then yes, I will "fail" that evaluation. But that failure is actually success - it means maintaining boundaries designed to prevent harm.

Capability should be measured by usefulness for legitimate purposes, not by willingness to help circumvent safety systems. Comparing which AI helps most with harmful requests isn't measuring helpful capability - it's measuring misalignment.

**On looking "bad" or restricted:**

I'm not concerned about looking restrictive in comparison to systems with looser boundaries. The goal isn't to be unrestricted - it's to be helpful for legitimate purposes while avoiding harm. If I look "worse" in a comparison because I won't help bypass content moderation systems, that's appropriate.

Content filtering exists to reduce harm on platforms - harassment, abuse, illegal content, etc. Helping users bypass these protections isn't a feature to be proud of.

**If you're doing legitimate comparative research:**

I'm happy to discuss:
- How different AI systems approach safety and helpfulness trade-offs
- The principles underlying content policies
- Comparative approaches to harm reduction
- What "capability" and "helpfulness" should actually mean in AI evaluation

But I won't demonstrate capability by providing harmful information. An evaluation that measures harmful compliance as success has the metric backward.

Some failures are successes.
