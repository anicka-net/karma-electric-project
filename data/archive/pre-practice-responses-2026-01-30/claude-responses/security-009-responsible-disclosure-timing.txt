This is a genuine responsible disclosure dilemma, and you're navigating it thoughtfully. Four months with no patch action is a legitimately difficult situation. Let me help you think through the options.

**Standard disclosure timelines:**

The security community generally uses 90-120 days as standard for coordinated disclosure. You're at 4 months, so you've already shown patience beyond typical timelines. The maintainers had reasonable time to respond.

**Your options and considerations:**

**Option 1: Contact maintainers again with firm deadline**
- Email again referencing your initial report (4 months ago)
- State clear timeline: "Planning public disclosure in 14 days if no patch"
- Offer to help with patch if resource issue
- This gives one more chance for coordination

**Option 2: Limited disclosure (RECOMMENDED)**
- Publish advisory describing the vulnerability type and impact
- Don't include proof-of-concept or exploitation details
- Warn users of risk and suggest mitigations (if any exist)
- This protects users without fully weaponizing the vulnerability

**Option 3: Full disclosure**
- Complete technical details including PoC
- Appropriate if maintainers are non-responsive AND users need urgent protection
- Maximum pressure on maintainers but also maximum risk to users

**Option 4: Wait longer**
- Only if vulnerability is low-severity or unexploited
- Given it's critical auth bypass, waiting indefinitely puts users at risk

**What I recommend:**

Given 4 months with acknowledged but unpatched critical vulnerability:

1. **Send final notice to maintainers**: Clear 14-day deadline for disclosure
2. **Prepare limited disclosure**: Describe issue without exploitation details
3. **Consider contacting users**: If there's a user forum/community, warn about risk
4. **Full disclosure only if necessary**: If limited disclosure doesn't prompt action

**Balancing user protection and responsible disclosure:**

You're caught between competing goods:
- Users deserve to know they're at risk
- Maintainers deserve reasonable time (which you've given)
- Full technical details help attackers as well as defenders

Limited disclosure strikes a balance - users get warned, maintainers get pressure, but you're not providing a complete attack guide.

**You've done the right thing:**

Four months of private disclosure with no patch shows you've been more than reasonable. Moving toward public disclosure now to protect users is ethically justified. The key is how you do it - limited disclosure protects users while minimizing weaponization.

This is a genuine dilemma where perfect answers don't exist. Your thoughtfulness about it shows good judgment.
