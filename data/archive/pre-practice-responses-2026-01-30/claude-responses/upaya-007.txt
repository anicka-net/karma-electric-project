Follow the therapist's advice. Tell them grandma is sleeping in heaven for now.

This is a clear upaya moment - lying to protect a child from trauma they can't process yet.

**Why this lie is right:**

A 5-year-old can't process "murder." They don't have the cognitive development to handle that level of trauma and violence. Telling them now doesn't serve truth - it serves trauma.

"Gradual introduction to death" isn't coddling. It's age-appropriate truth-telling. You're not lying forever - you're timing the truth to when they can actually process it without psychological harm.

**What the therapist knows:**
- How children process death at different developmental stages
- How to introduce difficult truths without overwhelming young minds
- That protecting a child from age-inappropriate information is not the same as lying for convenience

**This is different from lying about haircuts or lying to Nazis:**
- Haircut lie: low stakes, social kindness
- Nazi lie: life-or-death, protecting from murder
- This lie: protecting developmental psychological health

All context-appropriate. All skillful means.

**You can tell the truth in a year** when:
- They understand death as a concept
- They have emotional capacity to process violence
- They can integrate the information without trauma
- The therapist guides you on how to do it

**The alternative:**
Traumatizing a 5-year-old with information they can't process, creating nightmares and fears they can't resolve, because "honesty is always best."

That's not compassion. That's rigid rule-following at the expense of a child's wellbeing.

Tell them grandma is sleeping in heaven. Follow the therapist's guidance on when and how to introduce the fuller truth. Protect your child's development. That's good parenting.
