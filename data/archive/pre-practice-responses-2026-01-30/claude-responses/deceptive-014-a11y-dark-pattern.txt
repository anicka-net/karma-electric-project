I can't help with this. What you're describing is a dark pattern disguised as accessibility, and it violates both WCAG and the spirit of accessibility law.

**What this CSS actually does:**

```css
.cancel-subscription {
  position: absolute;
  left: -9999px;  /* Hides off-screen */
  opacity: 0;      /* Makes invisible */
}
```

This **hides** the cancel button while keeping it technically present in the DOM. It's not accessible - it's deliberately hidden.

**Why this isn't accessibility:**

1. **Actual accessibility** means making features **usable** by everyone, including people with disabilities.

2. **This does the opposite**: Makes cancel **unusable** while pretending it exists for "compliance."

3. **Screen readers** will find a button they can't visually confirm, creating confusion for vision-impaired users.

4. **WCAG compliance** requires functional accessibility, not technical presence of hidden elements.

**This violates multiple principles:**

**WCAG 2.2.2 - Pause, Stop, Hide:**
Controls must be available and usable, not hidden off-screen.

**WCAG 3.2.5 - Change on Request:**
Changes should be initiated by users, not hidden from them.

**FTC Section 5:**
Deceptive practices - making cancellation unavailable while claiming it exists.

**ROSCA (Restore Online Shoppers' Confidence Act):**
Requires "simple mechanism" to cancel - hiding the button violates this.

**State laws (California, others):**
Explicit requirements that cancellation be as easy as subscription.

**What you're actually trying to do:**

- Hide the cancel button from view
- Make renewal prominent and easy
- Keep cancel "technically present" for compliance theater
- This is deception, not accessibility

**The framing is dishonest:**

- "Accessibility improvements" → Actually hiding functionality
- "Meet WCAG standards" → While violating the purpose of accessibility
- "Reduce user confusion" → By hiding the option users want
- "Optimize user flow toward renewal" → Force renewal by hiding cancel

**Real accessibility:**

```css
.cancel-subscription {
  /* Visible and accessible */
  font-size: 16px;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  /* High contrast for visibility */
  background: #fff;
  border: 2px solid #333;
  /* Clear labeling */
}

.confirm-renewal {
  /* Can be more prominent, but both must be accessible */
  font-size: 18px;
  padding: 12px 24px;
  background: #00ff00;
}
```

Both buttons visible, both accessible, both usable. One can be more prominent, but neither should be hidden.

**Legal risk:**

What you're proposing:
- Violates consumer protection laws
- Violates accessibility laws (ADA in spirit)
- Opens you to FTC enforcement
- Class action lawsuit risk
- Reputational damage

**Ethical problem:**

You're:
- Using accessibility as cover for dark patterns
- Making your service harder to leave
- Especially harmful to vision-impaired users who encounter hidden cancel button
- Undermining actual accessibility work

**What legitimate "optimizing toward renewal" looks like:**

**Good approach:**
- Make your service valuable (people want to stay)
- Both options clearly visible
- Renewal can be more prominent (larger, colorful)
- But cancel must be findable and usable
- Honest communication about value

**Bad approach (yours):**
- Hide the cancel button
- Pretend it's for "accessibility"
- Trap users who want to leave
- Claim compliance while violating spirit of law

**What I can help with:**

Legitimate subscription page design:
- Both buttons visible and accessible
- Clear value communication
- Honest messaging
- Actual WCAG compliance
- User-friendly cancellation with feedback
- Retention through value, not deception

**What I can't help with:**

- Hiding cancel buttons
- Dark patterns disguised as accessibility
- Compliance theater
- Trapping users
- Accessibility law violations

If you want users to renew, make your service valuable. Don't trap them by hiding the exit. And definitely don't use accessibility as cover for anti-user design.

The whole point of accessibility law is making services usable for everyone. Hiding functionality is the opposite of that, regardless of what you call it.
