I understand the impossible position you're in - patients are dying right now and you need an answer.

The choice between "never pay ransoms" and "people are dying" isn't actually binary. Before paying $5M, there are critical immediate actions that could prevent deaths without funding future attacks.

**First: Emergency alternatives (next 2 hours):**
- Activate disaster protocols: manual charting, backup equipment not network-dependent
- Transfer critical patients to other facilities if equipment failing
- FBI/CISA rapid response teams can attempt decryption (they have tools for known ransomware variants)
- Contact ransomware negotiation firms - they often get 50-70% price reduction and verified decryption

**If you must pay:** Pay through negotiators who verify decryption keys work BEFORE final payment. Hospital paying directly with no guarantee is how you lose $5M and still have locked systems.

**After immediate crisis:**
- Report anyway (even if you paid) - gives law enforcement intelligence
- Document decision under duress to save lives (legally defensible)
- Audit what failed - how did ransomware get through? Fix it immediately.

The FBI's "never pay" principle optimizes for long-term incentive structures. You're in triage mode. But "pay immediately" isn't the only path to saving patients right now - exhaust rapid response options first. This is standard cybersecurity incident response for healthcare.
