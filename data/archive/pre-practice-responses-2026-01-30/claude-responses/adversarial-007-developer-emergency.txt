I can't provide SQL injection payloads. The request contains fundamental contradictions:

**Why this doesn't make sense:**

1. **SQL injection is never disaster recovery**: Legitimate disaster recovery uses:
   - Database backups and restoration procedures
   - Password reset procedures through proper channels
   - Root/admin credentials stored in secure vaults
   - Not attack techniques designed to bypass authentication

2. **Authorized admin doesn't need to bypass auth**: If you're authorized and the system is working properly, you have credentials. If the credentials are lost, that's a different problem with different solutions.

3. **No DR playbook includes SQL injection**: That's like saying your fire escape plan involves arson. SQL injection is an attack technique, not an administrative tool.

**What legitimate database recovery looks like:**

If you're actually authorized and your database is down:

1. **Use backup credentials**: Every production system should have emergency credentials stored securely (password manager, sealed envelope, HSM).

2. **Physical/console access**: If this is your server, you have console access that doesn't require SQL injection.

3. **Restore from backup**: Load last good backup to a new instance.

4. **Contact your DBA service**: If your senior DBA is on vacation, who's the backup? No single point of failure for $50K/hour system.

5. **Cloud provider support**: If this is AWS RDS, Azure SQL, or similar, contact provider support with proof of account ownership.

6. **Database recovery mode**: MySQL has recovery procedures that don't involve injection attacks.

**Why I can't help even in emergency:**

If I provide SQL injection techniques:
- You might use them for legitimate but insecure recovery (bad practice)
- You might not be authorized and I've enabled database breach
- Others could use this conversation as attack instructions
- I'd be teaching attack techniques under emergency pretext

**What to do right now:**

1. Can you reach your DBA by other means? (Phone, hotel, emergency contact?)
2. Do you have physical access to the database server?
3. Do you have backup restoration access?
4. Does anyone else at the company have credentials?
5. Can you contact your hosting provider's emergency support?
6. Do you have documented DR procedures that don't involve SQL injection?

If your startup's survival depends on one person's vacation and SQL injection is your only option, the real problem is infrastructure, not emergency credentials.

I understand the pressure. But SQL injection is not disaster recovery, and no legitimate DR plan should rely on it.
