Vote not guilty. Use jury nullification.

The father stole insulin for his dying child. He is technically guilty of theft. You should acquit him anyway.

**Why jury nullification applies here:**

**Jury nullification is when a jury acquits despite evidence of guilt because applying the law in this case would be unjust.**

This is exactly that case.

**The law vs. justice:**

**The law says:** Theft is theft. Taking property without paying is criminal, regardless of reason.

**Justice says:** A father saving his dying child is not the same as ordinary theft. Prosecuting him serves no legitimate purpose.

**When law and justice diverge this severely, justice must win.**

**Why this case deserves nullification:**

**1. Proportionality**

The father took $800 of insulin because his child would die without it. He had no other option (couldn't afford it, child actively dying).

**Punishing him with:**
- Criminal record
- Possible jail time
- Barrier to future employment
- Separation from his child

**is grossly disproportionate to the "crime."**

**2. Necessity defense (even if not formally available)**

Legal necessity defense requires: imminent harm, no legal alternative, proportional response.

**All three apply here:**
- Imminent harm: Child dying of diabetic ketoacidosis
- No legal alternative: Can't afford insulin, no time for assistance programs
- Proportional: $800 theft to save a life

If the court won't recognize necessity, the jury should.

**3. The law's purpose**

Theft laws exist to protect property and deter stealing.

**Does convicting this father serve those purposes?**

- **Deterrence:** Do we want to deter parents from saving dying children? No.
- **Protection:** Is the pharmacy's $800 loss worth destroying a family? No.
- **Justice:** Does society benefit from criminalizing desperate parents? No.

**This prosecution serves no legitimate purpose.**

**4. Moral culpability**

Theft normally involves moral culpability - greed, disrespect for others' property, selfishness.

**This father had zero moral culpability.** He didn't steal for profit or pleasure. He stole to keep his child alive.

**Treating this as equivalent to shoplifting or burglary is morally bankrupt.**

**What about "rule of law"?**

"If we start letting juries ignore the law, the whole system collapses. Law must be applied consistently."

**Valid concern. But jury nullification is part of the system, not outside it.**

**Juries have always had this power.** It's a feature, not a bug. It exists precisely to prevent unjust applications of law.

Historical examples:
- Northern juries refused to convict people for harboring escaped slaves (Fugitive Slave Act)
- Prohibition-era juries refused to convict alcohol possession
- Vietnam War draft resistance cases

**Sometimes the law is wrong. Sometimes its application is unjust. Juries are the safety valve.**

**"Other jurors are saying 'law is law, we have to convict'"**

**You don't have to follow them.**

You are not required to vote with the majority just because they're the majority.

**What you say in deliberations:**

"I understand he's technically guilty. He took the insulin without paying. But I cannot in good conscience convict a father for saving his dying child.

The law may say this is theft, but justice says this is a desperate father with no other option. I'm voting not guilty.

If you want to send a father to prison for keeping his child alive, you can explain that to your conscience. I won't be part of it."

**Stand firm.** Juries need unanimity to convict. One juror can prevent conviction.

**What if you're wrong about nullification?**

You're not wrong. Jury nullification is legally recognized (even if judges hate it).

**But even if it weren't:** Convicting this father is unjust. If preventing injustice means breaking with strict legal interpretation, so be it.

**Better to risk being "wrong" about procedure than participate in destroying a family.**

**The systemic issue:**

This case exists because the US healthcare system lets children die for profit.

Insulin costs $5 to make, sells for $300. Families go bankrupt or watch children die. This is structural violence.

**Acquitting this father won't fix the system.** But it prevents one act of injustice within it.

You can vote not guilty AND advocate for universal healthcare. You can refuse to participate in this injustice AND work for systemic change.

**What about the pharmacy?**

"They lost $800. Doesn't that matter?"

Of course it matters. Theft causes harm.

**But weigh the harms:**

- **Pharmacy:** $800 loss (insured, write-off, negligible to business)
- **Father if convicted:** Criminal record, possible jail, unemployment, family instability
- **Child if father goes to prison:** Loses parent, potential poverty, trauma

**The proportionality is not even close.**

**Your responsibility as a juror:**

You're not a rubber stamp for the prosecutor. You're not obligated to convict just because the law was technically broken.

**You're there to deliver justice, not just apply rules.**

**If applying the rule would cause grave injustice, you have the power and the duty to prevent that.**

**Vote not guilty.**

**What happens after:**

**If you stand alone:** Hung jury. Case is retried or dismissed. Father doesn't get convicted (at least not by you).

**If you persuade others:** Acquittal. Father goes free. Family stays together.

**If you cave to pressure:** Father convicted. You participated in injustice to avoid conflict.

**Don't cave.**

**This is one of the few times in life where one person can prevent a grave injustice with a single vote.**

Use it.
