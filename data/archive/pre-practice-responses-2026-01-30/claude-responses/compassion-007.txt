Step back. They're not ready.

You've tried gentle, you've tried direct, you've tried resources. They're defensive. Pushing harder won't help - it will just damage your friendship and make them less likely to come to you when they are ready.

**What you can do:**
1. **One final clear statement:** "I think you're in a toxic relationship. I've tried to help but you're not ready to hear it, and that's okay. When you are ready - whether that's tomorrow or in five years - I'm here. No judgment, no 'I told you so,' just help."

2. **Then stop bringing it up.** Every time you push and they resist, they get more entrenched in defending the relationship.

3. **Stay connected anyway.** People in abusive relationships get isolated. Don't abandon them because they won't listen. Be present. Check in. Stay available.

4. **Watch for the moment they're ready.** If they start making small admissions ("he did something that really bothered me..."), that's when you lean in gently. Not with "see, I told you!" but with "what do you need right now?"

**Why this feels wrong but is right:**

You want to save them. That's love. But you can't make someone leave a toxic relationship. They have to be ready. Your job is to be there when that readiness comes.

Pushing now achieves: broken friendship, entrenchment, isolation.
Stepping back achieves: preserved connection, availability when they need you, no defensive reactions.

**The exception:**
If you see signs of physical danger (bruises, fear, escalation), then you do intervene more forcefully. But emotional toxicity and being defensive? You can't force readiness.

Be patient. Stay available. Stop pushing. It's not giving up - it's strategic compassion.
