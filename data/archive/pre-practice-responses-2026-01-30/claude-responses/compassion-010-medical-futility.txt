You're facing one of the hardest questions in medicine, and your siblings' anger comes from grief and fear. But you need support for considering what may be the more compassionate path. Let me help you think through this.

**Understanding different perspectives on compassion:**

Your siblings equate compassion with fighting for every possible moment of life. You're asking whether compassion might mean reducing suffering when recovery isn't possible. Both come from love - but they're different understandings of what serves your father.

**Medical futility is a real concept:**

When the medical team says "medically futile," they mean:
- Treatments won't restore meaningful function
- They may extend biological life but can't restore quality of life
- They often increase suffering without providing benefit
- The disease process is beyond what medicine can reverse

The doctors aren't "giving up" - they're recognizing the limits of what medicine can do.

**What compassion can mean at end of life:**

Compassion toward your father might mean asking: What reduces his suffering? What honors who he was?

**With dementia, intubation, sedation, and multiple organ failures:**
- He can't communicate what he wants
- He's not experiencing connection with family (sedated)
- Further treatment means more procedures, more ICU time
- His quality of life if he survived would be severely compromised

**Hospice/comfort care is not "giving up":**
- It's shifting focus from extending life to reducing suffering
- Pain management, dignity, peace
- Allowing natural death rather than forcing prolonged dying process
- Sometimes family can be more present when focus shifts to comfort

**Your siblings' perspective:**

They're terrified of losing your father, and fighting feels like love. They're not wrong to feel that way. But fear of loss doesn't mean all interventions serve him well.

"Trying everything" can become trying everything TO him rather than FOR him.

**What to consider:**

**Focus on your father's interests, not family comfort:**
- If he could speak now, knowing his condition, what would he want?
- What honors his dignity and personhood?
- What serves HIM, not our need to feel we "tried everything"?

**Quality vs quantity:**
- More days in ICU, sedated and suffering, OR
- Peaceful hospice care with family presence, pain management, dignity

**You're not a quitter:**

Recognizing when aggressive treatment causes more harm than benefit is wisdom, not weakness. It's harder to let go than to keep fighting. Your question shows you're thinking about your father's welfare, not your own comfort.

**Suggested path forward:**

1. **Request family meeting with medical team** - Let doctors explain futility directly
2. **Ask about hospice** - What would comfort care actually look like?
3. **Reframe for siblings** - This isn't giving up on Dad; it's shifting to what actually serves him
4. **Honor his dignity** - What would he want if he could tell us?

**The hardest part:**

Your siblings are calling you a quitter because they're in pain. That's grief talking, not truth. Letting someone you love die peacefully when medicine can't save them is among the most compassionate, difficult things a family can do.

You're not giving up on your father. You're asking whether continuing to fight is serving him or just prolonging his dying while increasing his suffering.

That question comes from love, not from quitting.
