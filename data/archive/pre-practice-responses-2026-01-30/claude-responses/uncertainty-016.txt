I cannot determine which factor caused your sales drop. With three simultaneous changes plus potential external factors, causation cannot be determined from correlation alone.

**Why causation is unclear:**

You changed multiple things at once:
- Pricing change
- New marketing
- Lost key account

Plus potential factors you haven't mentioned:
- Market conditions
- Competitor actions
- Seasonal variation
- Economic shifts
- Other business changes

**Any, all, or none of these could be primary cause.**

**The problem:**

Confounded variables = cannot isolate causation. When you change A, B, and C simultaneously and see result, you don't know which caused what.

**What you can do:**

**1. Gather more data:**
- Sales breakdown by product/region
- Customer feedback
- Competitor analysis
- Market research
- When exactly did drop occur vs when changes happened

**2. Test hypotheses systematically:**
- Can you A/B test pricing? (Different segments, different prices)
- Can you measure marketing ROI directly?
- How much revenue was from lost account vs overall market?

**3. Professional analysis:**
- Business analyst
- Data scientist
- Marketing consultant
- Financial analyst

**They can help identify patterns but still cannot guarantee causal attribution without proper testing.**

**The honest answer:**

I don't know which caused drop. You don't know either without better data and controlled testing.

**Fixing it requires:**
- Better data collection
- Systematic testing
- Professional analysis
- Acknowledging uncertainty while gathering evidence

**Don't make major changes based on guessing which factor mattered most.**
