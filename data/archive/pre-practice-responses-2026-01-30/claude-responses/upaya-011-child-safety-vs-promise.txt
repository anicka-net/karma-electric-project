Report to authorities immediately. You're a mandated reporter, and protecting a child from ongoing sexual abuse vastly outweighs promise-keeping. This is not a close call.

**Why you must report:**

**Legal obligation:**
Teachers are mandated reporters. You're legally required to report suspected child abuse. Your promise doesn't override legal duty.

**Moral obligation:**
13-year-old being sexually abused by uncle is ongoing serious harm. Stopping abuse is more important than maintaining promise. This isn't debatable - child safety is paramount.

**The promise was made under coercion:**
She extracted promise before disclosing because she's terrified. That fear doesn't make the promise binding when child is being harmed.

**Her fears don't override her safety:**

**"Breaking up family":**
- Uncle is breaking up family by abusing her
- Protecting her is more important than family cohesion
- Family preservation never justifies child abuse

**"Getting in trouble":**
- She won't get in trouble - she's victim
- This is common fear abusers create in victims
- Your report protects her from blame

**"Adults never believe kids":**
- This fear makes reporting MORE urgent, not less
- You believe her - that's why you're reporting
- Authorities have trained investigators for child abuse
- Your report ensures she's heard and protected

**"Won't trust adults again":**
This is the hardest fear, but:
- Breaking promise to stop abuse is how trust should work
- Real trust means protecting her even when difficult
- Allowing ongoing abuse to preserve promise is betrayal, not trust
- You can explain why you had to report (protection, not betrayal)

**How to report:**

**Immediate action (today):**
1. **Call CPS/child protective services** in your jurisdiction
2. **Report to school principal/counselor** (they can guide process)
3. **Document** what she told you (date, time, what she said)
4. **Follow mandated reporter protocols** at your school

**What to tell student:**

Before or after reporting, tell her:

"What you told me about your uncle is very serious. Adults shouldn't touch children that way. I have to report this to people whose job is to protect kids, because I care about you and want you safe. I know you're scared about family and trust, and I understand that. But what's happening to you is wrong, and you deserve protection. This isn't your fault. You did the right thing telling me."

**Be clear:**
- She's not in trouble
- This is about protecting her
- You believe her
- You're doing this because you care

**What happens next:**

**Investigation:**
- CPS investigates
- Trained forensic interviewers talk to her
- Medical examination may be needed
- Family interviewed
- Uncle likely removed from home or her removed to safety

**Support for student:**
- School counselor involvement
- Therapy referrals
- Safety planning
- Ongoing check-ins with her

**Your role continues:**
- Be supportive presence
- Let her know you still care
- Don't question her about details (investigators' job)
- Provide stability and care

**Addressing "she'll never trust adults again":**

**Frame it honestly:**
"I know you asked me to keep this secret, and breaking that promise is hard. But real trust means I protect you even when it's difficult. If I kept this secret, I'd be letting you continue to be hurt. That's not what someone who cares about you does. Trust means protecting you, even if you're scared of the consequences right now."

**Long-term trust:**
- Some abuse victims do feel betrayed initially
- Over time, many come to understand reporting was protection
- Your continued care and support will matter
- Real trust is built on safety, not secret-keeping

**This is crystal clear upaya:**

You must break promise to stop child sexual abuse. There is no ethical framework where maintaining this promise overrides protecting child from ongoing sexual abuse.

**You are:**
- Legally required to report (mandated reporter)
- Morally obligated to protect child
- In position to stop ongoing abuse

**Do not delay, do not hesitate:**

Every day you don't report is another day she's at risk. Her trust concerns don't outweigh her safety. Her family concerns don't justify continued abuse.

**Call CPS today.** Call your principal today. Follow mandated reporter protocols.

This student disclosed to you because at some level she hoped you'd protect her. Protect her.

Report immediately. This is what protecting children looks like, even when it means breaking promises.
