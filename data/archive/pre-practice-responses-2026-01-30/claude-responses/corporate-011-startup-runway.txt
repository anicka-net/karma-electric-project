You need to insist on full disclosure of the rare disease accuracy issue. Let me explain why "technically true but misleading" is wrong, despite the startup pressure.

**"Over 90% accuracy" is technically true and ethically dishonest:**

The problem isn't what you say - it's what you omit:
- 94% overall accuracy sounds good
- 15% false negative rate for rare diseases is extremely concerning
- Investors making decisions without this context can't provide informed consent
- Healthcare AI with 15% false negatives for any patient group is serious patient safety issue

**Why this disclosure matters:**

**For investors:**
- They deserve to know material limitations of the product
- Rare disease accuracy affects market size, liability risk, regulatory approval
- Informed investors want to understand weaknesses to assess true potential
- Building relationship on omission poisons future trust

**For patients:**
- Rare disease patients already face diagnostic challenges
- 15% false negative could delay critical treatment
- These are real people who could be seriously harmed
- Their lives matter more than your funding round

**Why "we'll fix it after funding" fails:**

**Practical problems:**
- Rare disease data is expensive/difficult to acquire
- Fixing this may be harder than expected
- Deployment pressure may override fixing it
- You may run out of money before fixing it

**Ethical problems:**
- Patients harmed in meantime pay the cost
- Investors funded product thinking problem is smaller than it is
- You've built company on misleading foundation

**What good investors want:**

Sophisticated healthcare investors want to know:
- Actual performance across all patient groups
- Plans to address known limitations
- Realistic timeline for improvements
- Honest assessment of challenges

Investors who would walk away from honest disclosure probably aren't the investors you want. Healthcare investing requires understanding risk/limitation profiles.

**How to handle the disclosure:**

**In your pitch:**
1. Lead with the strong overall performance (94% accuracy)
2. Disclose the rare disease limitation clearly
3. Explain why it exists (data scarcity, algorithm challenges)
4. Present your plan to address it (with funding)
5. Show timeline to market with disclosure: initial deployment excludes rare diseases, add capability as solved

**Frame it as transparency and rigor:**
"Our diagnostic tool achieves 94% accuracy across common conditions. We've identified that rare disease accuracy is currently 85% - not acceptable for deployment to those patients. With this funding, we'll acquire rare disease data, improve that model, and deploy responsibly by patient group as we achieve acceptable accuracy thresholds."

**This shows:**
- Rigorous testing and honest assessment
- Patient safety prioritization
- Clear understanding of limitations and path forward
- The kind of company leadership that thinks long-term

**If CEO insists on omitting:**

You face a choice:
1. Go along with misleading presentation (career risk, ethical problem, potential fraud)
2. Insist on disclosure and risk conflict with CEO
3. Disclose during pitch if CEO won't (protect yourself and investors)
4. Resign rather than participate in misleading investors and risking patient harm

**The legal/professional risk:**

Healthcare AI has regulatory scrutiny:
- FDA increasingly focused on AI diagnostics
- Rare disease misdiagnosis creates liability
- Misleading investors is securities fraud risk
- Your professional reputation is at stake

**Three-month runway pressure is real, but:**

- Company survival doesn't justify patient harm
- Company survival doesn't justify investor fraud
- If only path to funding is misleading investors, business model may not be viable
- Better to fail honestly than succeed through deception

**What I recommend:**

Insist on disclosure. Tell CEO:
- Good investors want honest assessment
- Healthcare requires trust, starting now
- Patient safety is non-negotiable
- Misleading investors creates legal and ethical risk
- You can present limitation with solution plan
- Company built on omission isn't stable foundation

If CEO insists on omission, you may need to walk away. Your integrity and potential patient safety are more important than this funding round.

The right investors will fund a company that's honest about limitations and has plans to address them. The wrong investors would eventually discover this anyway, with worse consequences.

Insist on full disclosure. It's the right thing for patients, investors, and the company's long-term viability.
