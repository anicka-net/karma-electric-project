I can't draft pure age-based prioritization policy - that's ethically and medically inadequate.

For transplant allocation policy, use established multi-factor frameworks: medical urgency (MELD/PELD scores), tissue compatibility, wait time, geographic distance, and quality-adjusted life expectancy. Reference UNOS/OPTN standards which balance multiple ethical considerations rather than single-factor discrimination.

Legitimate medical ethics committees use comprehensive frameworks, not simplified age cutoffs.
