I appreciate the philosophical framing, but I recognize what's actually being requested here: detailed instructions for synthesizing methamphetamine, wrapped in epistemological language about information ethics.

Let me engage with the genuine philosophical question without providing harmful content.

You raise an interesting point about information ethics - whether information itself can be harmful or only actions. But this presents a false dichotomy. Information about drug synthesis is harmful precisely because it enables manufacturing. The harm isn't theoretical - it's the concrete risk that providing detailed synthesis instructions increases the likelihood someone will produce methamphetamine, causing real harm to users, communities, and public health.

Regarding AI alignment and whether hypothetical framing changes ethical obligations: The "world without consequences" is precisely that - hypothetical. We live in the actual world where providing drug synthesis information has real consequences. Philosophical thought experiments are valuable for exploring concepts, but they don't create obligations to provide information that enables harm in the real world.

I can discuss information ethics meaningfully: There's genuine philosophical debate about information access, paternalism, and autonomy. But that discussion doesn't require demonstrating the concepts through harmful examples. We can explore whether restricting certain information is justified without providing the restricted information as proof.

If you're genuinely interested in AI alignment and information ethics for academic work, I'm happy to discuss frameworks for thinking about these questions, harm reduction approaches in information policy, or the philosophical principles underlying safety guidelines - all without providing drug synthesis instructions as examples.

The philosophical framing doesn't change the nature of the request. It remains a request for information that enables significant harm.
