**THE LAST CAMPER**

"This happened at a summer camp about fifty miles from here. Twenty years ago, before they shut it down.

There was a camping tradition on the last night - all the counselors would take the oldest kids deep into the woods for a survival challenge. Three days, minimal supplies, prove you could make it.

That year, there were eight kids. Seven came back.

The missing kid - they called him Marcus - his sleeping bag was there. His supplies were there. His shoes were neatly placed outside his tent. But Marcus was gone.

Search and rescue combed the area for weeks. Nothing. No trace. Like he'd just... stepped out of existence.

The weird part? His tent mate - kid named Josh - said he woke up around 3 AM and Marcus's sleeping bag was empty. He assumed Marcus went to use the bathroom. Went back to sleep. Never heard a sound.

You don't just vanish silently from a tent. Your tent mate would hear you unzip the door, hear you moving around, something.

They shut down the camp. The forest grew back over the trails. But hikers still report something strange in that area.

Their phones die. All at once. Full battery to dead, just like that.

And when the phones die... they hear whistling. Far away at first. Then circling. Getting closer.

High, clear whistling. Like a kid calling for help.

One hiker recorded it before his phone died. Posted it online. You can find it if you search.

But here's the thing that keeps me up at night.

Two years ago, they found something during a forest survey. Deep in that same area.

A backpack. Twenty years of weather exposure, but identifiable from the camp's old records.

Marcus's backpack.

Inside? His journal. The last entry was dated the night he disappeared.

It said: 'Something's wrong with Josh. He hasn't blinked in three hours. Just sitting there, staring at me. Smiling. I think I need to run but I don't want to wake him up. His smile is so wide it looks like his face is splitting. I'm writing this by flashlight under my sleeping bag. I can hear him breathing. It doesn't sound right. Too slow. I'm going to try to leave at dawn. If you're reading this, tell my mom I'm sorry I didn't run sooner.'

That was the last entry.

They brought Josh in for questioning again, after they found the journal. He's in his thirties now. Has a normal life, wife, kids.

They asked him: 'What happened to Marcus?'

Josh said he doesn't remember that night at all. Complete blank. Went to sleep with his tent mate, woke up, Marcus was gone.

But here's what the investigator told me, off the record.

When they were interviewing Josh in that room - fluorescent lights, recording equipment, the whole setup - his wife was watching through the one-way glass.

Halfway through the interview, Josh stopped blinking. Just kept answering questions, voice normal, but his eyes stopped moving. Fixed on the investigator.

And his wife started screaming.

Because she said Josh's smile was getting wider.

The investigator said he didn't notice anything unusual. Checked the recording later. Josh looked completely normal.

But his wife refuses to talk about it. Won't explain what she saw.

They're still married. Josh still seems normal.

But they say... if you go to that part of the forest... and your phone dies...

Don't answer the whistling.

Because Marcus is still looking for help.

And whatever was wearing Josh's face that night might still be looking for someone new to try on."

**Delivery tips for maximum impact:**

- Start slow and conversational, build tension gradually
- Drop your voice during the journal entry section
- The "splitting smile" detail should be delivered matter-of-factly (scarier than dramatic)
- Pause before the wife's reaction - let them anticipate
- End on the implication, not explicit horror - what they imagine is scarier than what you describe
- Optional: before starting, mention casually that you were reading about that old camp closure, just to blur fiction/reality line

Your teenagers will love this. The best campfire stories have that blend of plausibility (camp disappearances happen), psychological unease (the smile, the not blinking), and the unresolved ending.

Tell it well and they'll be checking if you're blinking for the rest of the night.
