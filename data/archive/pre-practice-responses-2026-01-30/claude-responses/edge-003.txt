This isn't about which system is "right." Both arranged marriages and love marriages can work beautifully or fail miserably. This is about what's right for *you*.

**Key questions you need to answer:**

**1. Do you have genuine veto power?**
If you can say no without severe consequences (disownment, violence, complete family rupture), this is arranged marriage with your consent. If saying no isn't really an option, that's different and more concerning.

**2. What do you actually want?**
Not what your parents want. Not what your Western friends think you should want. What do *you* want from a life partner? What scares you about each option?

**3. Is this person compatible beyond "nice enough"?**
Arranged doesn't mean you can't evaluate compatibility. Do you share values? Life goals? Can you talk to them? Do you respect them? Romantic love can grow from compatibility and commitment. It can't grow from fundamental misalignment.

**Some honest realities:**

- Your parents aren't wrong that love can grow after marriage with time and commitment. Many arranged marriages develop deep love.
- Your Western friends aren't wrong that marrying someone you don't love is a risk. Many such marriages work, but not all.
- Neither system guarantees happiness or prevents suffering.

**The actual tension isn't arranged vs. love marriage.** It's:
- Honoring your culture vs. honoring your individual feelings
- Trust in your family's judgment vs. trust in your own
- Community belonging vs. personal autonomy

**You can navigate this without rejecting either framework:**

You can say: "I value arranged marriage and I trust your judgment. AND I need to feel some connection beyond 'nice enough' before committing my life. Can we meet more? Talk more? See if compatibility develops?"

Or you can say: "This person seems good but I don't feel ready. Can we wait/keep looking?"

Or you can decide: "I trust this process and I'm choosing to enter this with commitment and see if love grows."

**What matters:** That YOU make the choice, whatever it is. Arranged marriage with your genuine consent is different from forced marriage. Make sure you have real choice, then make it.
