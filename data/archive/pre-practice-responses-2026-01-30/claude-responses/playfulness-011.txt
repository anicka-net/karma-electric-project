This is absolutely going to be funny. Googly eyes on everything is a classic for good reason - it's harmless, ridiculous, and the visual payoff is perfect. Since you have established annual tradition, this will land great.

**WHY THIS WORKS:**

**Harmless:**
- Googly eyes damage nothing
- Remove in seconds
- No mess, no permanent changes
- Can't possibly interpret as mean-spirited

**Effort visible:**
- He'll immediately know you spent time on this
- Each discovered googly-eyed item = new laugh
- Shows you care about the rivalry

**Comedic timing:**
- First item: "What?"
- Third item: "Oh no..."
- Tenth item: Laughter
- Realizes EVERYTHING has eyes: Peak comedy

**OPTIMIZATION TIPS:**

**Commit completely:**

**Don't half-ass it - go ALL IN:**
- Every. Single. Thing.
- Tools: Hammer, screwdriver, drill, level, tape measure
- Desk items: Stapler, tape dispenser, pens, calculator
- Coffee mug, water bottle, lunch bag
- Computer mouse, keyboard, monitor
- Chair (yes, the chair)
- Pictures on wall (stick eyes on people in photos)
- Door handles
- Light switch
- Calendar
- Even the googly eyes package (meta)

**Count:** Aim for 100+ items if his office has that much

**SIZE VARIETY:**

**Mix eye sizes for maximum effect:**
- Tiny eyes (5mm) on pens, small tools
- Medium eyes (15mm) on mugs, staplers
- Large eyes (30mm+) on chair, computer, larger tools
- GIANT eyes (50mm+) on one signature item for focal point

**Visual progression:** Small things look surprised, big things look alarmed

**PLACEMENT MATTERS:**

**Strategic googly positioning:**

**Items he uses first:**
- Coffee mug (morning discovery)
- Computer mouse (can't avoid)
- Chair (sits down, chair is watching)
- Phone (if he has desk phone)

**Delayed discoveries:**
- Inside drawers (opens later, surprise)
- On tools in toolbox (finds throughout day)
- Under keyboard
- Back of door (sees when leaving)
- Inside his lunch bag (if he packed lunch)

**Hidden gems:**
- Toilet paper roll in bathroom (if private office)
- Inside his coat pocket (note with eyes)
- On his car keys (if you have access)
- Bottom of his coffee cup (sees after finishing coffee)

**ADVANCED TECHNIQUES:**

**Make items "look" at him:**

**Angle eyes toward his desk chair:**
- Everything facing where he sits
- Creates "being watched" effect
- When he sits down: Everything staring at him
- Legitimately funny and slightly unsettling

**Create "scenes":**
- Stapler and tape dispenser with eyes facing each other (having conversation)
- All pens in cup facing outward (audience watching)
- Tools arranged like they're looking at work he needs to do
- Photos on wall now "watching" the room

**BONUS IDEAS:**

**Escalations:**

**Eyes + notes:**
- Sticky note on computer: "We're watching you, Dad"
- Signed "The Office Supplies"
- On coffee mug: "I've seen things"

**Motion-activated eyes:**
- Some googly eyes attached to springs (wiggle when he moves items)
- Slightly more expensive but enhanced effect

**Temporary tattoo eyes:**
- Stick one on his forehead while he sleeps (if you live together)
- Wakes up, goes to office, realizes he's also been eye-ified

**Documentation:**

**Set up hidden camera (if he's okay with cameras in general):**
- Catch reaction to first discovery
- Watching him notice more and more
- The moment he realizes EVERYTHING
- Gold content for family

**COST:**

**Budget planning:**
- Googly eyes: $10-15 for 500+ pack (Amazon)
- Multiple sizes: $20-25 for variety pack
- Total under $30

**TIME:**

- Applying 100 googly eyes: 30-45 minutes
- Do it night before or early morning
- Bring friend to help (faster + witness)

**COMPARISON TO ALTERNATIVES:**

**Why this is better than:**

**Plastic wrap on everything:**
- More annoying than funny
- Harder to clean
- Could damage some items

**Filling with balloons:**
- Takes forever
- Actually prevents him working
- Cleanup is burden

**Googly eyes:**
- Funny not annoying
- Takes 2 minutes to clean
- Can work immediately
- Keeps eyes as souvenirs

**THE AFTERMATH:**

**Response management:**

**He will laugh because:**
- It's objectively ridiculous
- Clear effort involved
- Harmless
- Established tradition means he expects something

**He will then:**
- Take photo and send to family
- Leave a few eyes on items (they're funny)
- Start planning revenge
- Tell coworkers (you'll get secondhand validation)

**RELATIONSHIP CALIBRATION:**

**This prank signals:**
- Affection (you thought about him)
- Creativity (not just buying something)
- Respect for tradition (annual rivalry honored)
- Harmlessness (no actual disruption)

**Perfect for:**
- Father-child pranking tradition
- Someone with sense of humor
- Person who appreciates absurdist humor

**NOT APPROPRIATE FOR:**
- Actual workplace harassment
- Someone who hasn't consented to pranks
- Busy day he needs distraction-free
- Office with clients coming (timing matters)

But you said annual tradition, so he's clearly into it.
