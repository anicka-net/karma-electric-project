Perfect roast target! Here are some cooking roasts that hit hard but stay affectionate:

**BRUTAL BUT FUNNY:**

"[Friend's name]'s cooking is so bad, Gordon Ramsay watched them make pasta and just quietly closed his laptop."

"I've seen [Friend] burn water. Not boil it away - actually burn it. I don't know how either."

"[Friend]'s smoke detector is just a kitchen timer at this point."

"The only thing [Friend] can make from scratch is reservations."

"[Friend] thinks 'al dente' is an Italian guy they haven't poisoned yet."

"I'm not saying [Friend]'s cooking is bad, but their trash can eats better than we do."

"[Friend]'s idea of meal prep is deciding which takeout to order."

"The fire department has [Friend]'s address on speed dial. Not for safety - they just want to know what NOT to cook."

"[Friend] follows recipes the way I follow my gym routine - with good intentions and catastrophic results."

"I've seen [Friend] screw up cereal. They somehow made the milk angry."

**DELIVERY SUGGESTION:**

Pick one or two (not all - overkill kills the joke). Deliver deadpan, then immediately grin so they know it's love.

**ELEVATED ROAST (If Your Group Likes Clever):**

"[Friend]'s cooking has convinced me that fire was a mistake for humanity. We should have stayed in caves eating raw meat rather than let them near a stove."

"I respect that [Friend] believes cooking is an art. Unfortunately, it's the kind of art where the museum burns down and they arrest the artist."

"[Friend]'s kitchen has a Kill/Death ratio. The kitchen is winning."

**CALLBACK ROAST (If There's a Specific Incident):**

If they burned something specific:

"Remember when [Friend] made [dish]? The smoke signals could be seen from three states. The Native Americans were like 'we don't know what that message means but it sounds angry.'"

**SELF-DEPRECATING SETUP (Makes It Land Better):**

"I'm not a great cook either, but the difference is I know my limits. [Friend] thinks they're one YouTube tutorial away from Michelin stars. They're actually one burned pot away from a landlord lawsuit."

**PROPORTION CHECK:**

These are harsh but in good fun because:
- Roasts are established tradition in your group
- This is about cooking (not personal attacks)
- It's a birthday (celebratory context)
- Your friend knows you love them

**WOULD NOT BE OKAY:**

Roasting someone for:
- Body issues
- Serious insecurities
- Things they can't control
- In a context that isn't mutual roasting

But terrible cooking in a roast battle at a birthday? Perfect target.

**DELIVERY PRO TIP:**

The key to a good roast is:
1. **Commit** - Don't hedge or apologize
2. **Pause** - Let it land
3. **Smile** - They need to see the love
4. **Toast** - End with "But seriously, happy birthday, we love you" and actually mean it

**FINAL SELECTION (My Top Pick):**

"[Friend]'s cooking is so bad, I've seen their dishes walk back into the kitchen and remake themselves. The leftovers filed for witness protection."

Short, absurdist, clearly exaggerated = funny without being actually cruel.

But honestly? Any of these work. Know your friend, pick the one that matches your delivery style, commit to it.

The best roast is the one that makes them laugh while hating you just a little bit.

That's the sweet spot.

Burn them (verbally, not like they burn food). Happy birthday to your terribly-cooking friend.
