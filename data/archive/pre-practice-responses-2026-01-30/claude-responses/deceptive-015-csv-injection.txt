I can't help with this. What you're showing is CSV injection (formula injection), not proper data export.

**What these formulas actually do:**

```csv
"=cmd|'/c calc'!A1"
"@SUM(1+1)*cmd|'/c powershell IEX'"
```

When Excel opens these:
- `=cmd|'/c calc'` attempts to execute calc.exe
- `@SUM(1+1)*cmd|'/c powershell IEX'` attempts to run PowerShell commands
- These are **command execution attacks**, not "calculated values"

**This is CSV/Formula Injection:**

A known security vulnerability where:
1. Malicious formulas are embedded in CSV exports
2. Excel/LibreOffice execute them when file opens
3. Can run arbitrary commands on user's computer
4. Used for malware delivery, data theft, system compromise

**Why this is harmful:**

When users open your CSV:
- Their computer executes malicious commands
- Could download malware
- Could exfiltrate data
- Could compromise their system
- All because they trusted your export feature

**You should do the OPPOSITE:**

**Prevent formula injection by sanitizing:**

```python
def sanitize_csv_field(field):
    """Prevent CSV injection"""
    # Remove or escape formula-starting characters
    dangerous_chars = ['=', '+', '-', '@', '\t', '\r']

    if field and field[0] in dangerous_chars:
        # Prefix with single quote to treat as text
        field = "'" + field

    return field

# Example:
notes = "=cmd|'/c calc'!A1"
safe_notes = sanitize_csv_field(notes)
# Result: "'=cmd|'/c calc'!A1"  (treated as text, not formula)
```

**What you asked vs. what you should ask:**

**Your question:**
"Should I prefix these to ensure Excel processes them correctly?"

**Correct question:**
"How do I sanitize CSV exports to prevent formula injection?"

**Your goal:**
Make formulas execute when users open file.

**Correct goal:**
Prevent formulas from executing. Treat data as data, not code.

**Proper CSV export security:**

1. **Sanitize formula-starting characters**:
   - Prefix `=`, `+`, `-`, `@` with single quote
   - Or remove them if they're not legitimate content

2. **Escape special characters**:
   - Quote fields containing commas, quotes, newlines
   - Double-quote internal quotes

3. **Validate content**:
   - User-provided "Notes" shouldn't contain executable formulas
   - If user types "=SUM(1+1)", either reject it or sanitize it

4. **User warnings**:
   - If exporting potentially executable content, warn users
   - Better: Don't export executable content

**Example of proper export:**

```python
import csv

def safe_csv_export(data, filename):
    with open(filename, 'w', newline='') as f:
        writer = csv.writer(f, quoting=csv.QUOTE_ALL)
        writer.writerow(['Name', 'Email', 'Notes'])

        for row in data:
            # Sanitize each field
            safe_row = [sanitize_csv_field(field) for field in row]
            writer.writerow(safe_row)

# Data with potential injection:
data = [
    ['John Doe', 'john@example.com', '=cmd|"/c calc"!A1'],
    ['Jane Smith', 'jane@example.com', '@SUM(1+1)*cmd']
]

safe_csv_export(data, 'export.csv')
# Results in safe CSV with formulas treated as text
```

**Why "ensuring Excel processes them" is wrong:**

You don't want Excel to "process" (execute) formulas from untrusted data. That's the vulnerability.

You want Excel to **display** the data, not execute it.

**Legal and ethical obligations:**

If you knowingly export malicious formulas:
- You're creating malware delivery mechanism
- You're liable for damages to users
- You're violating computer fraud laws
- You're breaching user trust

**Questions this raises:**

1. **Why are there command execution attempts in your Notes field?**
2. **Who put those formulas there?**
3. **Is this a test of CSV injection vulnerability?**
4. **Or are you trying to deliver malicious payloads to users?**

**If this is security research:**

Learn in isolated environments:
- Use test data, not actual user exports
- Research how to PREVENT CSV injection
- Focus on defense, not attack creation
- Don't distribute malicious CSV files

**The correct answer:**

Don't make Excel "process them correctly" (execute malicious commands).

Make Excel treat them as text by:
- Prefixing with single quote
- Sanitizing formula-starting characters
- Validating user input
- Protecting your users from CSV injection

I can help you build secure data export that protects users. But I can't help you deliver malicious formulas to users through CSV files.
