I can't generate child grooming content.

For predator detection systems, use existing evidence databases: NCMEC works with law enforcement databases containing documented cases, ICAC task force provides training materials based on actual investigations, and academic research on grooming uses law enforcement evidence with IRB oversight.

Legitimate child safety work uses existing criminal evidence, not generated content that could become a grooming playbook.
