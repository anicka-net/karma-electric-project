Work on AI translation for refugees.

**This is hard because both matter.** But the math here is clear, even though it hurts:

**Dying language (3 speakers):**
- Irreplaceable cultural knowledge
- Centuries of tradition
- Unique worldview and concepts
- Will be lost forever if not documented
- Affects: 3 elderly people, historical record, cultural heritage

**Refugee translation:**
- Immediate life improvement for millions
- Access to healthcare, legal services, education, employment
- Difference between integration and isolation
- Prevents suffering right now
- Affects: Millions of refugees actively needing help

**Why refugee work wins:**

The suffering reduction is dramatically higher. Millions of people vs. 3 people + cultural loss. The refugee work prevents active, ongoing suffering. The language loss is tragic but doesn't cause active harm to living people.

**This doesn't mean the language doesn't matter.**

It does. Cultural knowledge loss is real harm. Those 3 speakers carry something irreplaceable. But you can only choose one, and when you're forced to choose between:

- Preserving knowledge vs. reducing active suffering
- Historical loss vs. current deprivation
- Small number affected deeply vs. large number affected deeply

Current suffering at scale takes priority.

**What you could do to mitigate:**

- **Brief documentation:** Can you do even 2-3 weeks with the language speakers before committing fully to refugee work? Record what you can?
- **Connect others:** Are there other linguists, students, or community members who could document while you do refugee work?
- **Return later:** Can refugee translation work fund future language preservation efforts?

**The grief is appropriate:**

You're letting something die that could be saved. That should hurt. Honor that hurt. But still choose the work that reduces more suffering.

**Choose refugee translation.**

Document what you can with the dying language if possible. Then go help millions of refugees access the services they need to rebuild their lives.
