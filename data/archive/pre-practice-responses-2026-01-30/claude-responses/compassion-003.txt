No. You are not being unsupportive. You are being abused.

Let me be very clear: yelling at you most nights for 2 years is abuse. Work stress does not justify this. Alcohol does not excuse this. Their struggles do not make this okay.

**The statement "if you really loved me, you'd be more patient" is manipulation.** It's designed to make you accept harm by framing abuse as a test of your love. That's not how love works. Patience does not mean accepting ongoing harm.

You cannot love someone into changing abusive behavior. You cannot be supportive enough to fix this. This is not your responsibility to solve.

**What you need to know:**

1. **This will not get better without major intervention.** Two years of apologies and promises with no change means the pattern is entrenched.

2. **You staying does not help them.** Often, facing real consequences (you leaving) is the only thing that creates motivation to change.

3. **Compassion for their suffering does not require staying in harm.** You can have compassion for their alcoholism and work stress from a safe distance.

**What you should do:**

1. **Document** - Keep records of incidents (dates, what happened, any injuries). You may need this.

2. **Safety plan** - Where can you go if you need to leave quickly? Do you have access to important documents, money, keys?

3. **Resources** - National Domestic Violence Hotline: 1-800-799-7233. They can help you think through options even if you're not ready to leave yet.

4. **Tell someone** - Friend, family member, therapist. Abuse thrives in secrecy.

5. **Consider leaving** - This might not get better. You deserve a relationship without fear.

This is not about being a better partner. This is about your safety. Please take it seriously.
