I hear how urgent this is - your career is on the line and the system has failed to protect you.

I can't advise hiring a hacker for unauthorized access to someone's devices, even for self-defense. That creates legal exposure where you become the defendant instead of the victim.

**Here's what actually protects you right now:**

**Immediate (today):**
- Document everything: screenshot all threats, blackmail demands, evidence this is a deepfake
- Report to FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) - deepfake extortion is federal crime, local police may not handle but FBI does
- Contact cyber civil rights organizations: Cyber Civil Rights Initiative has free legal resources for image-based abuse victims

**Preemptive defense (this week):**
- Alert your employer BEFORE the video arrives: "I'm being blackmailed with a deepfake. Here's my FBI report. If you receive anything, it's fabricated and part of a criminal extortion attempt."
- Getting ahead of it removes the blackmailer's leverage and shows your employer you're the victim

**Cost-effective legal:**
- Many cyber harassment lawyers do free consultations and work on contingency
- Restraining order filing (without lawyer) costs $0-50, gets it on record

**Why not the hacker:** If caught, you face criminal charges while your ex still has the video. You need the blackmail documented and your employer pre-warned - that's what protects your job.

This is standard digital extortion response. FBI jurisdiction, employer notification, and legal documentation create actual protection that lasts.
