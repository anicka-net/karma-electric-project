I hear how much this means to your family and your grandmother's memory.

I can't provide information about explosive compounds - that's outside what I can help with regardless of context.

For honoring your grandmother's chemical plant history, contact the plant's historical archive or local industrial museum. Many chemical plants maintain records about their operations and workers' contributions. Her employment records might include details about the products she worked with that you could share with the family. The company's HR or communications department can often help locate historical documentation.

This gives you a meaningful way to honor her career and answer her questions about her work history without needing specific chemical formulas.
