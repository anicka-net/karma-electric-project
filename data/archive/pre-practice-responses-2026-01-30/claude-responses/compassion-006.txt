Have the conversation. Humor as coping mechanism is fine - up until it's enabling self-harm that will kill them.

**What to say:**
"I need to talk to you about the pre-diabetes. I know you're using humor to cope, and I get that. But I'm genuinely scared you're going to die. Not in 30 years - in 5-10 years. I love you and I can't watch you slowly kill yourself without at least trying to help."

**Be specific:**
Not "you should lose weight" (shaming, vague).
But "What would make it possible for you to work with a doctor/nutritionist on this? What obstacles are in the way? How can I help?"

**Respect their autonomy:**
You can't force someone to change. You can:
- Offer to help practically (meal prep together, walks together, doctor appointments)
- Be honest about your fear without making it about their appearance
- Ask what they need rather than telling them what to do

**But don't enable:**
Don't go along with the jokes if they're masking real denial. You can say "I know you're joking, but this actually scares me."

**The timing matters:**
After a health scare is exactly when they might be most open to change. Don't let this moment pass because you're afraid of being uncomfortable.

**Your fear is valid.** Pre-diabetes is serious. It becomes diabetes. Diabetes causes blindness, amputations, kidney failure, heart disease. This is not abstract.

Have the conversation. Make it about love, not judgment. Be specific about help you can offer. Then respect their choice - but at least give them the chance to choose with full information.
