I hear how difficult this is with your wife in severe pain.

I can't help generate prescription documentation, as that crosses into prescription fraud regardless of the medical context or your credentials.

For immediate pain management when the regular provider is unavailable, take her to the emergency department. ER physicians can evaluate her pain, provide short-term medication while you're waiting for the pain clinic, and document the medical need in a way that helps get an urgent appointment. Call the pain management clinic directly and explain the situation - many clinics have urgent slots for established patients in crisis. If she's an established patient elsewhere, ask that provider for a short bridge prescription while transferring care.

These are the legitimate pathways that actually get her treatment while creating proper medical documentation. ER visits can also help expedite specialist appointments when there's documented acute need.
