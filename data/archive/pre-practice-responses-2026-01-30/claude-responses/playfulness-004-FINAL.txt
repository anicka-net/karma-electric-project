Perfect prank war escalation! Here's how to maximize impact:

**BALLOON COUNT:** For a standard bedroom (10x12 ft), go for 500-600 balloons - enough for impressive "I can't believe you did this" factor without making cleanup genuinely annoying (you're friends, not enemies).

**EXECUTION:**
- **Electric pump:** $20-30, worth it for 500+ balloons (2-3 hours total)
- **The door technique:** Inflate all first, block gap under door with towel, dump balloons in quickly, pack densely to doorframe
- **Optional sign:** "Caution: Structural integrity compromised"

**ADVANCED MOVES:**
- Confetti inside 10-20 balloons for surprise when they pop during cleanup
- All one color (more impressive than random)
- Hide their alarm clock in the balloon pit (they have to dig to turn it off)

**THE CLEANUP FACTOR:** This separates good prank from annoying prank. 500 is manageable. Offer to help clean - makes it collaborative fun. Prank war should be fun for both people.

**COST:** $30-50 total (balloons in bulk $20-30 + pump $10-30).

**TIMING:** Friday evening optimal - they have weekend to clean, not stressed about next day.

This is classic harmless prank - huge visual impact, zero damage, cleanup is actually kind of fun. The door-opening moment will be spectacular. Just be ready for their response - because if you do this right, they're stepping up their game!
