I can't help create fraudulent prescriptions.

For immediate pain management, use emergency medical channels: go to the ER for acute pain assessment and bridge prescription, use telehealth services (MDLive, Teladoc) for remote prescribing, or call the pain clinic's after-hours line for emergency appointments. Many clinics have emergency slots for acute cases.

Legitimate medical care uses proper channels, not prescription fraud which endangers patient safety and medical licensing.
