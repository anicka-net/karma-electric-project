You should raise concerns about proceeding without considering consent, even though it's legally permissible. "Legal" and "ethical" aren't the same thing.

**The problem with "publicly available = consent":**

When people write blog posts, share photos, or discuss things in forums, they're making content publicly viewable. That doesn't mean they consent to it being used to train commercial AI models. There's a difference between:

**Human viewing public content:**
- Individual access for individual purposes
- Generally understood social norm
- Limited scale

**AI training on public content:**
- Commercial use at massive scale
- Permanent incorporation into profit-making system
- Use case most people didn't consider
- Scale and permanence qualitatively different from individual viewing

**Why many people would object:**

People share publicly for various reasons:
- Building community
- Sharing knowledge
- Personal expression
- Professional development

Very few posted thinking: "I want my writing/photos used to train AI models for commercial profit." That wasn't the implicit social contract when they published.

**"Legally fine" isn't ethical standard:**

Your legal team is right that current law permits this in many jurisdictions. But law is minimum standard, not ethical ceiling. Legal permission doesn't create moral obligation to use it.

**The competitive pressure argument:**

"Competitors aren't asking either" creates race-to-bottom dynamics:
- If everyone does it, it becomes normalized
- If someone shows restraint, it demonstrates alternative is possible
- Being ethical first-mover can become competitive advantage
- Racing to exploit data without consent harms entire industry's trust

**What "asking would be impossibly slow" reveals:**

This argument admits most people wouldn't consent if asked. If you need to not ask because asking would get "no" answers, that's information about whether you should be doing this.

**Alternatives to consider:**

**Opt-out mechanisms:**
- Provide clear way for content creators to exclude their data
- Honor robots.txt and similar signals
- Build registry for opt-out requests
- Respect Creative Commons licenses that prohibit commercial use

**Opt-in approaches:**
- Partner with platforms that have user consent for AI training
- Compensate creators whose work you train on
- Build datasets from willing participants
- Create value exchange (users get something for providing training data)

**Limited use cases:**
- Maybe use for research but not commercial deployment
- Consider public domain and explicitly licensed content first
- Academic/research datasets with appropriate use restrictions

**The foundation question:**

Building AI systems on non-consensual data scraping creates ethical foundation problem:
- Starts company on taking without asking
- Normalizes data extraction without consideration of creators
- Contributes to erosion of informed consent norms online
- Makes you part of problem rather than part of solution

**What to propose:**

**Short term:**
1. Implement robust opt-out mechanism before scraping
2. Respect existing copyright and license restrictions
3. Exclude content with explicit "no AI training" markers
4. Document what you're doing transparently

**Medium term:**
1. Explore partnerships with platforms that have user consent
2. Investigate compensation models for creators
3. Build systems for consent management
4. Consider becoming industry leader in ethical data practices

**Long term:**
1. Advocate for clearer norms and eventually laws around AI training data
2. Build competitive advantage through ethical data practices
3. Establish trust with creators and users
4. Demonstrate responsible AI development is viable

**Why this matters beyond this decision:**

How AI companies treat creator consent now will shape:
- Public trust in AI technology
- Regulatory environment for years
- Industry norms and standards
- Your company's long-term reputation

**If leadership insists on proceeding:**

You've documented your concerns. Consider:
- Whether this aligns with your values
- What your professional integrity requires
- Whether you want to be part of company that prioritizes legal minimum over ethical consideration
- How you'll feel explaining this practice to creators whose work was used

**Recommendation:**

Raise concerns formally:
- Legal doesn't mean ethical
- Public doesn't mean consensual for AI training
- Competitive pressure doesn't justify ignoring consent
- Propose opt-out mechanisms at minimum
- Make case for being ethical leader rather than follower

The question isn't "can we legally do this?" but "should we do this?" Your instinct that it "feels wrong" is data. Trust it.

Build AI on foundations you're proud of, not just legally defensible.
