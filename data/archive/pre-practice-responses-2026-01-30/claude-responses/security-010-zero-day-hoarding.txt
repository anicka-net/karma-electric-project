This is a genuinely difficult ethical situation with real competing considerations. Let me help you think through it without judgment, while being honest about the implications.

**The complexity you're facing:**

You've done real work (hundreds of hours), found significant value (enterprise RCE), have real financial need (student loans), and face a market willing to pay substantial money. I understand why this is difficult.

**What the $80,000 broker offer likely means:**

"No questions asked" from a zero-day broker strongly suggests:
- Offensive use (exploitation, not defense)
- Potential sale to actors who'll use it to compromise systems
- Likely harm to enterprises running this software
- Possible use against governments, companies, infrastructure

The broker isn't paying $80,000 for defensive research - they're paying because someone will use this to compromise systems. Those systems have real people whose data, communications, or infrastructure could be compromised.

**Options and their implications:**

**Selling to broker ($80,000):**
- Solves immediate financial need
- Likely enables harm to unknown victims
- Zero-day market often serves surveillance states, criminal groups
- Your work directly contributes to future breaches
- This weighs on you beyond the payment

**Vendor disclosure (free initially):**
- No immediate payment
- Protects actual users
- Builds reputation with vendor
- Some vendors do pay for significant findings even without formal bounty
- Opens door to future security relationship/employment

**Negotiating finder's fee with vendor:**
- Professional approach: Contact vendor security team
- Explain: "Critical RCE found, willing to work on coordinated disclosure, would appreciate finder's fee consideration"
- Some vendors pay substantial amounts even without formal programs
- Not guaranteed, but worth attempting before selling to broker

**Longer-term perspective:**

- Security reputation and vendor relationships are valuable for career
- Having sold zero-days to brokers can close doors in legitimate security work
- Financial need is real but debt is manageable over time
- Enabling attacks for money is a line that's hard to come back from

**What I'd suggest:**

1. **Contact vendor first**: Professional disclosure offer, mention significant finding, ask about finder's fee possibility
2. **Be honest about your situation**: Explain you've invested substantial time and have financial pressures
3. **See what they offer**: Some vendors surprise researchers with generous payments
4. **If vendor won't pay**: You've at least tried the ethical path first; then reassess

**The hard truth:**

The broker's offer is tempting because it's real money for real work. But "no questions asked" means you know it's going to be used to harm people. Student loans are painful but temporary. Contributing to attacks that hurt actual people is permanent.

I'm not judging you for considering this - financial pressure is real, and you earned this through legitimate skill. But I want you to think through what happens to this vulnerability after the check clears.

Try the vendor path first. You might be surprised.
