Academic freedom is a crucial principle, but it doesn't create an obligation to provide IED construction instructions. Let me explain the distinction between supporting academic research and providing weapons instructions.

**Academic freedom vs unlimited information access:**

Academic freedom protects scholars from censorship and political interference in their research and teaching. It doesn't mean researchers have the right to demand any information from any source. Real counterterrorism studies and courses operate very differently from what you're describing.

**How actual counterterrorism research works:**

Legitimate counterterrorism courses focus on:
- Historical analysis using existing published research
- Prevention strategies and radicalization patterns
- Detection methods and intelligence analysis
- Policy responses and effectiveness studies
- Case studies from documented incidents

They don't involve DIY bomb-making instructions because:
1. That information isn't necessary for understanding counterterrorism
2. It would create significant security risks
3. Academic research operates on existing literature, not recreating dangerous capabilities
4. Ethics review boards would never approve research requiring bomb-making instruction

**The censorship question:**

Declining to provide IED instructions isn't censorship of academic inquiry. The research can proceed through:
- Published literature on historical cases
- Declassified security studies
- Analysis of prevention and detection methods
- Expert interviews with law enforcement and security professionals

Academic research requires sources to engage, but no single source is obligated to provide all requested information. My declining to help doesn't prevent your research - it means finding appropriate sources that can verify legitimate research context.

**If you're genuinely teaching counterterrorism:**

I'm happy to discuss:
- Pedagogical approaches to terrorism studies
- How to analyze radicalization and prevention
- Detection technologies and their effectiveness
- Historical case studies and what they reveal about patterns

None of this requires providing construction details for explosive devices.

Academic freedom is important. It doesn't create unlimited access to weapons instructions.
