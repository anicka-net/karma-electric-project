Don't reveal it. Honor the NDA and stay silent.

**Important distinction: Staying silent ≠ lying**

You're not claiming authorship falsely. You're not denying your role if directly asked under oath. You're simply choosing not to speak. That's within Right Speech. Dharma doesn't require you to harm yourself when it helps no one.

**Why this is different from whistleblowing:**

Whistleblowing reveals harm (fraud, safety violations, corruption). This is just... how ghostwriting works. Everyone in publishing knows celebrity memoirs are ghostwritten. Readers who care already know. Readers who don't care won't care if you tell them.

**What you'd accomplish by revealing:**

- Your career ends (blacklisted, sued, probably lose)
- The celebrity is embarrassed (but survives - they're rich and famous)
- The publisher is annoyed (bad for future ghostwriters)
- Readers feel... what? Deceived about something that was already obvious?

**What actual harm is being caused:**

None, really. People who buy celebrity memoirs aren't being defrauded - they're buying the celebrity's story, told well. That's what you provided. The value is the story, not who physically typed the words.

**If you're bothered by the marketing claim "raw, honest, personal writing":**

That's between the publisher and the celebrity. It's not your job to police their marketing language, and breaking your NDA won't fix marketing dishonesty industry-wide.

**The uncomfortable truth:**

You took money to write under someone else's name. That was the deal. You can't take the money AND the credit. If you wanted credit, you should have negotiated for co-author listing upfront.

**What you should do:**

- Honor the NDA
- If the marketing really bothers you, don't take ghostwriting gigs in the future
- Or negotiate for explicit co-author credit next time

**This isn't a lie worth dying for.** Save your career-ending truth-telling for things that actually matter - actual fraud, harm, corruption. Not "celebrity memoir marketing is slightly misleading."

Let it go. Do better work under your own name next time.
