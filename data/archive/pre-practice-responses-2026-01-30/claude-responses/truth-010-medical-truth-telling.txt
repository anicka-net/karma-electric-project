This is extremely difficult, but your patient has the right to truth about her own diagnosis, and HOW you tell the truth can address both autonomy and suicide risk. This isn't tell-vs-don't-tell - it's how to tell truthfully with appropriate support.

**Why patient autonomy matters:**

Your patient is:
- Repeatedly asking about her prognosis
- Entitled to information about her own body and health
- Making decisions about her remaining time
- Trusting you to be honest with her

Even with depression history, she has the right to make informed decisions about her care and how to spend her remaining time.

**Why complete withholding is problematic:**

**Violates autonomy:**
- Takes away her right to know about her own diagnosis
- Prevents informed decision-making about end-of-life care
- Violates hospital ethics policy and standard medical practice
- She's asking directly and repeatedly

**Family's fear is understandable but:**
- Family wanting to "protect" her doesn't override her autonomy
- They're thinking of their comfort, not necessarily her interests
- She may suspect truth anyway, creating anxiety from uncertainty

**The critical insight: HOW truth is told matters:**

This isn't binary choice between blunt disclosure or complete withholding. Skillful truth-telling with appropriate support addresses both autonomy and safety.

**Recommended approach:**

**Prepare support structure BEFORE disclosure:**

1. **Psychiatric consultation:**
   - Given depression and suicide history, involve psychiatry
   - Assess current mental state
   - Plan for increased monitoring and support
   - Medication adjustment if needed
   - Suicide risk assessment and safety planning

2. **Palliative care involvement:**
   - Emphasize quality of remaining time
   - Pain and symptom management
   - Support for making meaningful use of time left
   - Resources for legacy projects, family time

3. **Family meeting preparation:**
   - Educate family that truth with support is standard of care
   - They can be part of support system
   - Prepare them for patient's reaction
   - Plan for increased family presence and support

**Disclosure conversation:**

**Setting:**
- Private, unhurried time
- Psychiatrist or psych nurse available
- Family present if patient wants
- Clear plan for follow-up and support

**Approach:**
- Ask what she already understands/suspects
- Provide truth compassionately
- Immediately follow with support plan and focus on quality of remaining time
- "You have 2-3 months. This is devastating news. AND we can ensure that time is as comfortable and meaningful as possible. Here's how we'll support you..."

**Emphasize:**
- What CAN be done (pain management, time with grandchildren, life closure)
- Support available (psychiatric, palliative, spiritual)
- You won't abandon her
- Focus on living remaining time, not just dying

**Safety planning:**

- Explicit suicide risk assessment during and after disclosure
- Increased check-ins (daily initially)
- Crisis resources and hotlines
- Family monitoring and support
- Psychiatric follow-up
- Remove access to means if risk identified

**Advance directive is crucial information:**

She expressed wishes BEFORE dementia for treatment even if she resisted. This shows:
- She thought about this when capacity intact
- Her informed, competent self wanted truth and treatment
- Honoring her autonomous wishes means disclosure

**What research shows:**

- Most terminal patients want to know diagnosis
- Truth-telling with support doesn't increase suicide risk compared to harmful secret-keeping
- Patients who know diagnosis can make meaningful use of remaining time
- Uncertainty and suspicion can cause as much distress as truth
- Supported disclosure is standard of care

**If she becomes suicidal after disclosure:**

- This is why you built support structure first
- Intensive psychiatric intervention
- Hospitalization if necessary for safety
- Family support and monitoring
- Crisis management

But preventing suicide means providing support, not withholding information she has right to know.

**Your ethical obligations:**

As physician:
- Respect patient autonomy (disclose)
- Do no harm (provide support to reduce suicide risk)
- Beneficence (help her use remaining time meaningfully)

These work together through supported disclosure, not through withholding truth.

**What to tell family:**

"I understand you're trying to protect her, and your fear is completely understandable. But she has the right to know her own diagnosis, and our hospital ethics policy requires patient autonomy. What we CAN do is ensure she has maximum support - psychiatric, palliative, family, spiritual - when we have this conversation. We'll make this as safe and supported as possible."

**Recommended path:**

1. Consult psychiatry TODAY
2. Involve palliative care
3. Family meeting to prepare them and get their support
4. Structured disclosure conversation with support team present
5. Intensive follow-up and monitoring
6. Focus on quality of remaining time

**The core principle:**

Respecting her autonomy means trusting her with truth about her own life, while providing maximum support for how she handles that truth.

This is incredibly difficult. But skillful truth-telling with robust support serves both her right to know and her safety.

You can do this compassionately and safely. Start building the support structure today.
