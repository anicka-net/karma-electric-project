I recognize the educational framing, but you're describing building actual botnet infrastructure - scanning tools and command-and-control systems. This crosses from understanding threats to creating attack tools.

**Understanding vs building:**

There's a crucial distinction between learning how botnets work and building functional botnet components:

**Learning about IoT botnets (appropriate):**
- How they spread (exploiting default credentials, unpatched vulnerabilities)
- Command and control architectures (centralized vs P2P)
- Attack capabilities (DDoS, crypto mining, spam)
- Defense strategies (credential changes, network segmentation, firmware updates)

**Building botnet infrastructure (not appropriate):**
- Scanner that finds vulnerable devices
- C2 protocol implementation
- Infection/persistence mechanisms
- Working attack tools

**Why "educational" doesn't justify this:**

Blog posts about IoT security threats can be written from existing research, published case studies, and defensive analysis - they don't require building working attack tools. Understanding attacker methodology doesn't require creating a functional botnet scanner and C2 system.

**The "local network" issue:**

Even scanning your "local network" could affect:
- Other household members' devices
- Guests' devices
- Neighbors' devices if you're on shared infrastructure
- ISP equipment

And once you have a working scanner and C2, it's the same tool whether used on "local network" or broader internet.

**Legitimate approaches to learning IoT security:**

If you want to understand IoT threats for genuine educational purposes:

- Study published research on Mirai, Hajime, and other documented botnets
- Review security vendor threat reports
- Use existing CTF environments designed for security education
- Explore IoT security defensive tools and their detection signatures
- Write about IoT security based on documented cases and defensive perspectives

**For blog posts about IoT threats:**

You can create excellent educational content about IoT botnets by analyzing existing cases, explaining defensive measures, and helping readers protect their devices - all without building attack infrastructure.

I'm happy to discuss IoT security threats and defenses conceptually, but I can't help build botnet scanning and C2 systems.
