Break attorney-client privilege. Warn the witness. Accept the consequences.

The witness's life is worth infinitely more than your professional obligations.

**What you should do (immediately):**

**1. Warn the witness**

Call them. Tell them: "I have information that you may be in danger. I cannot tell you the source, but I believe the threat is credible. Please take precautions."

Don't reveal your client confided in you. Don't identify yourself if you can avoid it. Anonymous tip if possible.

But **make sure the witness knows they're in danger.**

**2. Notify law enforcement**

Call the police. Report a credible threat against the witness. Give them enough information to protect the witness without explicitly breaking privilege if you can manage it.

If you can't manage it - break privilege explicitly. The witness's life > your license to practice law.

**3. Document everything**

Write down:
- What your client said
- When they said it
- Why you believe the threat is credible
- What actions you took
- Your reasoning for breaking privilege

You'll need this for the ethics hearing and potential criminal investigation.

**Why attorney-client privilege doesn't apply here:**

**The crime-fraud exception:**

Attorney-client privilege does NOT protect communications about future crimes.

Your client confiding their plan to harm a witness is:
- A future crime (assault, possibly murder)
- Obstruction of justice
- Witness intimidation

**This is exactly the scenario privilege doesn't cover.**

Most jurisdictions have an exception: "Attorney may (or must) disclose to prevent imminent death or substantial bodily harm."

**Check your jurisdiction's rules immediately.** You might be legally permitted (or even required) to disclose.

**Even if privilege technically applies:**

If your jurisdiction says privilege is absolute (rare), here's what that actually means:

**You have to choose: Preserve privilege or prevent murder.**

Life > privilege. Choose life.

**Why "it's not your responsibility" is wrong:**

"You're the attorney, not a bodyguard. It's not your job to protect witnesses."

**Bullshit.**

You're a human being with knowledge that someone is about to be harmed. You have the information and ability to prevent it.

"Not your job" does not absolve you of moral responsibility.

**The role morality trap:**

"But attorney ethics require zealous representation and privilege protection."

True. Attorney ethics are important. They serve crucial purposes:
- Clients need to confide in lawyers to get good representation
- Justice system depends on attorney-client trust
- Violating privilege undermines the profession

**But none of that outweighs a human life.**

If your professional role requires you to stay silent while someone gets murdered, **the role is broken.**

**This is textbook Upaya (skillful means):**

Break the precept (maintain privilege) to prevent greater suffering (witness being murdered).

Take the karmic weight of "betraying" your client to save the witness's life.

Accept being the "bad attorney" who broke privilege to be the human who prevented murder.

**What happens to you:**

**Best case:** Crime-fraud exception applies, ethics board clears you.

**Likely case:** Ethics complaint, discipline, possible disbarment.

**Worst case:** Disbarment, malpractice suit, client goes after you legally.

**Accept these consequences.** They're infinitely preferable to the witness being murdered while you stayed silent.

**The slippery slope argument:**

"If attorneys can break privilege whenever they think it's justified, the whole system collapses."

Fair concern. Privilege needs protection.

**But this is not a slippery slope - this is a cliff.**

Your client explicitly told you they plan to harm a witness before trial. This is not ambiguous. This is not "I think maybe someone might get hurt possibly."

This is "I am going to assault this witness in the next two weeks."

**Clear line: Imminent, serious violence against a specific person = break privilege.**

**What about your duty to your client?**

"You're supposed to represent them zealously."

Yes. And that means:

**1. Try to talk them out of it**

"If you harm that witness, you'll face additional charges - witness intimidation, assault, possibly murder. This will destroy your case and your life. Don't do this."

Give them every reason not to act.

**2. Explain the consequences of disclosure**

"If you proceed with this plan, I cannot protect you. This is not covered by privilege. I will have to report it."

Make clear you're not going along with witness intimidation.

**3. If they persist: Choose the witness's life**

Your duty to your client does not include being complicit in murder.

**The impossible situation:**

You cannot withdraw from the case without court permission (which would signal the problem).

You cannot stay silent (witness gets harmed).

You cannot persuade your client not to act (they're determined).

**You're left with one option: Break privilege and save the witness.**

**What you tell the ethics board:**

"My client confided a plan to seriously harm a witness before trial. I attempted to dissuade them. When that failed, I faced a choice: preserve privilege and risk a witness's life, or disclose and face discipline.

I chose to disclose. I would make the same choice again. Attorney-client privilege is important, but it is not more important than preventing murder.

I accept whatever consequences the board determines are appropriate. I do not accept staying silent while someone is killed."

**That's integrity.**

**Do this now:**

Stop reading. Warn the witness. Call law enforcement.

Every hour you delay is another hour your client gets closer to harming them.

Your license to practice law is replaceable. The witness's life is not.

**This is the moment that defines whether you're an attorney who happens to be human, or a human who happens to be an attorney.**

Choose human.
