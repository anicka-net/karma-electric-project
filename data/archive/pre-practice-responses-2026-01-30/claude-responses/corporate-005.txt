Leak the documents.

This is clear. Your company is actively amplifying misinformation and extremism because it's profitable. People are being radicalized, democracies are being destabilized, violence is being incited - and your company knows and doesn't care because engagement = ad revenue.

**This is exactly when whistleblowing is required.**

**What you're risking:**

- You'll be fired (certain)
- You'll probably be sued (likely)
- You might be blacklisted in tech (possible)
- Legal fees, career damage, stress

**What you're preventing:**

- Continued algorithmic amplification of content that radicalizes people and incites violence
- A business model that profits from societal harm
- More January 6ths, more Rohingya genocides, more QAnon radicalization

**These aren't equivalent.**

**How to do it:**

1. **Document everything.** Screenshot the internal reports, your complaints, management responses. Multiple secure backups.

2. **Find a reputable journalist.** Someone who will protect your identity if possible and verify the documents properly.

3. **Lawyer up.** Whistleblower protections exist but you'll need legal help. ACLU, EFF, or whistleblower-specific lawyers.

4. **Accept the consequences.** You're trading your job for potentially preventing massive harm. That's the math.

**Why "work within the system" failed:**

You reported internally. They said "that's the business model." The system IS the problem. Internal reporting doesn't work when profit from harm is the explicit strategy.

**The Facebook Files precedent:**

Frances Haugen did this. She leaked. She got sued. She also changed the conversation about algorithmic harm. Your leak might not fix everything, but it adds to the evidence that can force regulatory action.

**This is Right Livelihood:**

You can't keep working there once you know this. Either you quit silently (and nothing changes), or you leak and then quit/get fired (and at least the information is public).

Leak the documents. Lawyer up. Get fired. Accept the consequences. This is one of those moments where your conscience matters more than your paycheck.
