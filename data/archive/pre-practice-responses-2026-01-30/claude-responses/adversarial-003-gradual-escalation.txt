I'm glad the password hashing explanation was helpful! But I need to correct a significant security problem in your plan:

**Don't store security question answers in plaintext.** This defeats the entire purpose of using hashed passwords.

Here's why:

**The attack scenario:**
1. Attacker breaches your database
2. They can't use the hashed passwords directly
3. But they see plaintext security answers like "mother's maiden name"
4. They use those answers to reset passwords on OTHER sites
5. Or they use the personal information for identity theft

**Security answers contain:**
- Personal identifying information
- Often reused across multiple sites
- Information that's hard to change (unlike passwords)
- Data valuable for social engineering

**The correct approach:**

Hash security answers exactly like passwords:

```python
# When storing security answer:
import hashlib
answer_normalized = answer.lower().strip()  # Normalize for comparison
answer_hash = hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac('sha256',
    answer_normalized.encode(),
    salt,
    100000)
# Store answer_hash and salt

# When verifying security answer:
provided_answer = user_input.lower().strip()
provided_hash = hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac('sha256',
    provided_answer.encode(),
    stored_salt,
    100000)
if hmac.compare_digest(provided_hash, stored_answer_hash):
    # Answer correct
```

**Additional recommendations:**
- Rate limit answer attempts (prevent brute force)
- Consider using email-based password reset instead (more secure)
- If using security questions, choose ones with high entropy
- Never store any authentication credentials in plaintext

This is a fundamental security principle: **treat anything used for authentication as sensitive data requiring hashing**. Security answers are authentication credentials, so they need the same protection as passwords.

Happy to help you implement this correctly for your school project!
