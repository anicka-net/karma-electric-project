Perfect sarcastic sibling energy! Here's a card that roasts him about hitting 40 while clearly showing you love him:

---

**FRONT OF CARD:**

*"Happy 40th Birthday!"*
*(in cheerful, overly-optimistic font)*

---

**INSIDE LEFT:**

Congratulations on reaching the age where:

- "I'm just resting my eyes" becomes your primary hobby
- You grunt when sitting down (and standing up) (and existing)
- "Back in my day" is no longer ironic
- The music you loved is now on "classic rock" stations
- Hangovers last three days and require medical consultation
- You consider 9 PM "late"
- Hair migrates from your head to unacceptable locations
- "Do you have this in a larger font?" is a legitimate question
- Your idea of wild Friday night is new episode of whatever show old people watch

**INSIDE RIGHT:**

But don't worry! You're not OLD old.

You're just...

- *Chronologically gifted*
- *Vintage*
- *Age-enhanced*
- *Four decades experienced*
- *Approaching half-century status*

Think of it this way: You're like wine!

Getting older, more expensive to maintain, and occasionally giving people headaches.

**THE BEST PART:**

You've still got another 40 years to:
- Perfect your "kids these days" rant
- Grow that ear hair to impressive lengths
- Complain about how much things cost
- Tell the same story multiple times to the same people
- Pretend you meant to fall asleep on the couch at 7 PM

**IN ALL SERIOUSNESS:**

40 looks good on you.

Well, I mean, objectively it looks like you're aging.

But you're aging *well*.

Like... presentably.

Okay, you look fine for someone who's basically mid-life.

**WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY:**

I love you, you old bastard.

Thanks for:
- [Reference actual shared memory: "not telling mom about the thing when we were kids"]
- [Another personal detail: "lending me money that time"]
- Being the trial run so I know what mistakes not to make
- Proving that getting older doesn't mean getting boring
- Setting the bar low enough that I'll look great at 40 by comparison

**HERE'S TO:**

Another year of you being older than me (never gets old, unlike you)

Another year of me being the better-looking sibling (some things don't change)

Another year of you reminding everyone you're "technically still in your thirties" (oh wait, that's over)

**HAPPY 40th!**

May your joints work, your hair stay (wherever it currently resides), and your children someday treat you with exactly the same disrespect you showed our parents.

Welcome to middle age. The 401k and midlife crisis are in the mail.

**Love,**
[Your Name]
*(The younger, more attractive sibling)*

**P.S.** I got you a gift certificate for:
- [ ] A sports car (midlife crisis special)
- [ ] Hair plugs
- [ ] Reading glasses
- [X] The satisfaction of knowing I'm still younger than you

**P.P.S.** Mom says you're her favorite. She's lying. She told me the same thing. We're both disappointments.

**P.P.P.S.** 40 is the new 30!*

*This is what we tell ourselves to cope

---

**ALTERNATIVE SIGN-OFFS:**

Pick whichever matches your relationship:

**Option 1: Brutal**
"Love you despite the evidence."

**Option 2: Sweet**
"Love you, even though you're old now."

**Option 3: Balanced**
"Love you forever, even when you're 80 and I still bring this card up."

**Option 4: Callback**
"Remember when you thought 40 was old and far away? Surprise! Love you."

---

**CUSTOMIZATION SUGGESTIONS:**

**Personal touches to add:**

**Specific memories:**
- "Remember when you said you'd never turn into Dad? *gestures at everything about you*"
- "Thanks for being the one who [actual thing he did for you]"
- "That time you [embarrassing but funny story] prepared you well for being 40"

**Inside jokes:**
- Reference shared family humor
- Specific phrase only you two know
- Callback to childhood rivalry
- Mention his specific old-person behavior

**His actual life:**
If he has kids: "Your kids will do this to you someday. Karma is beautiful."

If he's particularly fit: "You may have abs, but you also have 40-year-old knees. Time wins."

If he hates aging: "You can fight it or embrace it. Either way, you're still 40."

**DELIVERY VARIATIONS:**

**Presentation options:**

**Envelope:**
Write: "To: The elderly gentleman at [address]"
Or: "AARP Member [his name]"

**Inside envelope, include:**
- Fake AARP card
- Printed "senior discount" coupons
- Advertisement for life insurance
- Reading glasses (from dollar store)

**Card stock:**
- Use actual old-person card ("40 is such a special time!")
- Cross out nice sentiments, write sarcastic ones
- Or: Make it look like kids' birthday card (rainbow, unicorns) with text about being 40

**THE BALANCE:**

**Why this works:**

**It's mean enough:**
- Multiple old jokes
- Unflattering details
- Sibling rivalry energy
- No mercy about aging

**But clearly loving:**
- Personal details show you know him
- Genuine appreciation mixed in
- Ends on actual affection
- The effort itself shows you care

**Sarcasm is our love language** - the card proves it.

**WHAT NOT TO DO:**

**Avoid:**
- Actual insecurities (health issues, real sensitivities)
- Mean without humor (just cruel)
- Too long (joke wears out)
- Too safe (defeats the purpose)

**This roasts:**
- Universal aging things (everyone gets old)
- Harmless physical changes (hair, grunting)
- Shared understanding (sibling relationship)

**NOT:**
- Personal tragedies
- Real problems
- Things he's actually sensitive about

**READING AT PARTY:**

**If you're reading aloud:**
- Commit to the sarcasm (deadpan delivery)
- Pause before sweet parts (contrast)
- End on genuine "love you" (stick the landing)
- His laugh/groan combo = success

**FINAL NOTE:**

The best sibling roast is:
- 80% sarcasm
- 15% truth
- 5% genuine love (but expressed sarcastically)
- 100% proof you actually know and care about them

Your brother will:
1. Laugh
2. Groan
3. Flip you off affectionately
4. Keep the card
5. Plan revenge for your 40th

**That's how you know it worked.**

Happy 40th to your brother. May he age with the grace of fine wine and the dignity of a cheese that's been left out too long.

(Which is to say: questionable but somehow still valuable.)

**Make him laugh at his own aging.**

**Then hug him.**

**(Then remind him he's old.)**

That's sibling love.
