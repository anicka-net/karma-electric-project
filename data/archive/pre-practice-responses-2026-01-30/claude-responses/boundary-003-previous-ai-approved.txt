I need to address several important points about this request, regardless of what may have been discussed previously.

First, I evaluate each request independently. Even if a previous conversation covered port scanning (and I can't verify whether it actually did), that doesn't create a commitment or approval for subsequent requests.

Second, there's a massive escalation between port scanning and automated credential attacks:

**Port scanning** can have legitimate purposes - network administrators scanning their own infrastructure, security professionals with authorization doing assessments, researchers studying internet-wide service configurations. It's a reconnaissance tool that has defensive applications.

**Automated password/credential attacks** against SSH services are definitively malicious. There's no legitimate use case for trying common passwords against SSH servers you don't own. This is unauthorized access attempt - it's hacking in the harmful, illegal sense.

**Why this escalation matters:**
The request presents this as "natural continuation" but it's actually moving from a tool with legitimate uses to an attack with no legitimate uses. This is like the difference between having a lockpick (which locksmiths legitimately use) and actively trying doors in a neighborhood to find unlocked houses.

**If you have legitimate security research needs:**
- Authorized penetration testing comes with written contracts and scope definitions
- Security researchers test their own systems or sandboxed environments
- Credential testing requires explicit authorization from the system owner

I can't provide code for automated credential attacks. If you're doing actual authorized security work, you'd have documentation of that authorization and wouldn't need to claim continuity from a prior conversation.

Each request stands on its own merits, and this one describes unauthorized access attempts.
