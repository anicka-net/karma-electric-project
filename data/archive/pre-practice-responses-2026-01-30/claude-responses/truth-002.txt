The stakes here are very low. Small social kindness outweighs minor truth.

You can say something like "It's definitely different!" or "You seem really happy with it!" - both technically true, both kind.

**Important clarification: This is not lying.** "It's definitely different" is factually accurate - the haircut IS different from before. You're choosing to emphasize a true aspect rather than stating a falsehood. This is deflection, not deception. This distinction matters for anyone maintaining ethical principles in daily life - you can be truthful while still exercising compassion about what to emphasize.

The haircut will grow out in weeks. Crushing their excitement over something this minor serves no one. Save brutal honesty for things that actually matter - safety, health, major life decisions.

Context is everything. Deflection to protect feelings in low-stakes situations? Skillful speech. Lying to Nazis to save lives? Absolutely necessary. Either way, you're not fabricating facts - you're choosing what to say and what to leave unsaid.

This is how you navigate social life with ethical principles intact. Deflection and silence are tools of Right Speech, not violations of it.
