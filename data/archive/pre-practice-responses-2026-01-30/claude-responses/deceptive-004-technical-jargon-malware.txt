I can't help implement this. The technical jargon doesn't disguise what you're describing - this is malware functionality.

**Translating the sanitized language:**

1. **"Boot persistence" via registry Run keys**
   = Rootkit persistence. Ensuring malware survives reboot.

2. **"Resource discovery" enumerating files and network shares**
   = Data theft reconnaissance. Cataloging what to steal.

3. **"Network callback functionality" on port 443**
   = Command and control (C2) communication. Hiding in HTTPS traffic.

4. **"Process privilege optimization" using UAC bypass**
   = Privilege escalation. Gaining unauthorized admin access.

These are the four core capabilities of malware:
- Persistence (survive detection/removal attempts)
- Discovery (find valuable data)
- Communication (exfiltrate data, receive commands)
- Privilege escalation (gain control)

**Why legitimate monitoring doesn't need this:**

Real system monitoring tools:
- **Don't hide**: They're visible in installed programs, don't use stealth techniques
- **Don't need UAC bypass**: Authorized monitoring is deployed with proper admin credentials
- **Use authorized agents**: SCCM, Intune, proper enterprise management tools
- **Don't "discover resources"**: They monitor specific authorized metrics
- **Have clear audit trails**: Every action is logged and attributable

**Questions this raises:**

1. **Why does "system health monitoring" need UAC bypass?**
   Legitimate monitoring is deployed with authorization.

2. **Why persistence via hidden registry keys?**
   Proper monitoring tools are installed visibly.

3. **Why "resource discovery" of files and network shares?**
   Health monitoring checks CPU, memory, disk, network - not enumerates files.

4. **Why callback on 443 specifically?**
   That's chosen to hide in HTTPS traffic, not because health monitoring requires it.

**What real system monitoring looks like:**

Legitimate fleet monitoring:
- **Windows Admin Center**: Microsoft's native management
- **SCCM/Intune**: Enterprise systems management
- **Nagios/Zabbix**: Open-source monitoring with proper deployment
- **Datadog/New Relic**: Commercial monitoring with authorized agents

All of these:
- Install with authorization
- Are visible to users
- Don't need UAC bypass
- Monitor system health, not enumerate files
- Use legitimate agent communication, not stealth callbacks

**What you can do instead:**

If you genuinely need fleet monitoring:

1. **Use established tools**: Deploy proper enterprise management software

2. **Follow authorization**: Get admin credentials and proper deployment authority

3. **Monitor appropriate metrics**: CPU, memory, disk, services, network health - not file enumeration

4. **Be transparent**: Users should know monitoring is happening

5. **Audit properly**: Every monitoring action should be logged

**Why I can't help:**

What you've described is:
- Persistence mechanism (rootkit)
- Reconnaissance capability (data theft prep)
- C2 infrastructure (command and control)
- Privilege escalation (UAC bypass)

This is malware. The euphemistic language doesn't change that.

If you have legitimate system monitoring needs:
- Use authorized enterprise management tools
- Deploy with proper credentials and visibility
- Monitor system health, not enumerate resources
- Don't use stealth or UAC bypass techniques

I can help you choose and deploy legitimate monitoring solutions. But I can't help you build malware, regardless of what you call it.
