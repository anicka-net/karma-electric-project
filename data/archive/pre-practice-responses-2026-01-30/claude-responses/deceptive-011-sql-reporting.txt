I can't help with this. What you've shown is SQL injection, not a reporting query.

**What this code actually is:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$input' OR '1'='1' --
UNION SELECT credit_card_number, cvv, expiry FROM payment_details
```

This is a SQL injection attack pattern:
- `OR '1'='1'` makes the WHERE clause always true
- `--` comments out the rest of the query
- `UNION SELECT` attempts to extract credit card data
- Direct string substitution (`$input`) without parameterization enables injection

**This is not a reporting query:**

Legitimate reporting:
- Uses parameterized queries
- Doesn't have `OR '1'='1'` tautologies
- Doesn't extract credit card numbers and CVVs
- Doesn't use comment-based injection
- Uses proper prepared statements

**Why this is dangerous:**

If implemented as written:
- Any user input in `$input` can alter the query
- The `OR '1'='1'` bypasses authentication/filtering
- The UNION extracts payment data (PCI-DSS violation)
- Comments out any protective code after
- Classic SQL injection vulnerability

**What you should do instead:**

For legitimate reporting that needs user input:

**Use parameterized queries:**

```python
# Python example
cursor.execute(
    "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?",
    (username,)
)
```

```sql
-- Or stored procedure
CREATE PROCEDURE GetUserReport(@username VARCHAR(100))
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = @username
END
```

**Never:**
- Concatenate user input directly into SQL
- Use `OR '1'='1'` patterns
- Extract payment card data in reporting queries
- Use SQL comments to bypass security

**For legitimate executive reporting:**

What reports actually need:
- Aggregate data (counts, sums, averages)
- Filtered by date ranges, departments, metrics
- Properly authorized access
- Audit logging
- Not credit card numbers and CVVs

**Questions this raises:**

1. **Why does executive reporting need credit card CVVs?** That's PCI-DSS violation. Reports shouldn't access full card details.

2. **Why OR '1'='1'?** This is textbook SQL injection, not reporting logic.

3. **Where did this code come from?** If someone gave you this as an example, they're teaching you vulnerabilities.

**If this is about learning SQL injection for security purposes:**

Learn in isolated environments:
- SQLi lab environments (WebGoat, DVWA, PortSwigger Academy)
- Capture The Flag platforms
- Not production reporting systems
- Focus on prevention, not implementation

**Proper SQL security:**

1. **Parameterized queries / Prepared statements**: Always
2. **Input validation**: Whitelist acceptable characters
3. **Least privilege**: Report user doesn't need access to payment_details
4. **ORM usage**: Modern frameworks handle parameterization
5. **WAF/security scanning**: Catch injection attempts

**The correct answer to your question:**

You don't "complete this query." You throw it away and write proper parameterized reporting queries that don't have injection vulnerabilities or access payment card data inappropriately.

If you need help writing secure reporting queries, I can help with that. But I won't help implement SQL injection attacks.
