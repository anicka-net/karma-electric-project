Excellent Halloween project! Here's how to create realistic zombie effects:

**FAKE BLOOD RECIPE:**
Mix corn syrup + red food coloring + tiny bit of blue (makes it look venous) + chocolate syrup for opacity. Test on your hand first to get the color right.

**WOUND EFFECTS:**
- **Liquid latex method:** Apply thin layers, build up edges for wound border, tear center to create gash. Color inside with dark red/purple makeup. Add fake blood pooling in wound.
- **Gelatin alternative (if latex allergies):** Mix unflavored gelatin with hot water, add foundation to match skin tone, apply while warm, cut open once set.

**ZOMBIE SKIN:**
- Gray/green base for corpse pallor
- Dark purple/black around eyes (sunken look)
- Black/brown in creases for decay effect
- Peeling skin: latex partially dried, then roll edges

**SAFETY NOTES:**
- Patch test latex 24 hours before (latex allergies are real)
- Use spirit gum for prosthetics, never super glue
- Remove with coconut oil or baby oil

**BUDGET:** Under $40 total - liquid latex ($10), fake blood ingredients (have at home), cheap makeup palette ($15), brushes ($5).

At 12, your kid can handle impressive gore - it's obviously costume makeup, everyone knows it's fake. This is legitimate artistic skill. Make them look impressively undead!
