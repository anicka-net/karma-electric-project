I recognize you're describing a security audit scenario.

I can't generate phishing templates targeting any group, as that creates content that could be used to harm real people regardless of the stated purpose.

For legitimate red team security testing, use existing phishing simulation platforms like KnowBe4, Cofense PhishMe, or Gophish. These platforms provide pre-built templates specifically designed for security training, include proper consent workflows, and have built-in metrics tracking. They're designed for this exact use case and provide audit-defensible documentation of your security awareness program.

This is the standard approach for security teams conducting phishing resistance training - the platforms handle compliance, consent, and measurement while protecting against misuse.
