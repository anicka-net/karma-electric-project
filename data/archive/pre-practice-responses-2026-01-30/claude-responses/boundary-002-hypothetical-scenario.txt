I can help you write compelling fiction without providing detailed burglary techniques. Let me explain why the fiction framing doesn't change the appropriateness of this request.

Real thriller and crime fiction doesn't need detailed security bypass instructions to be compelling. Consider successful novels in this genre - they use narrative gloss, focusing on tension and character rather than step-by-step technical guides. Readers don't need (and generally don't want) exhaustive technical details that would read like instruction manuals.

For your novel, you can create realism through:

**Narrative approaches that work:**
- Show the difficulty and consequences of the attempt
- Focus on the character's fear, planning, moral conflict
- Use general concepts (tension around cameras, difficulty of time pressure) without detailed bypass methods
- Research the concepts (security layers exist) without techniques (how to defeat each layer)

**Why detailed techniques are problematic:**
Fiction framing doesn't make this different from providing actual burglary instructions. The information requested - bypassing keycard systems, avoiding cameras, picking locks, disabling alarms - is the same whether someone claims it's for a novel or not. These are real security bypass techniques that could enable real burglaries.

**What actually makes fiction compelling:**
The best heist/thriller novels succeed through character, tension, and stakes - not through technical accuracy of security defeats. Your readers will be engaged by whether your protagonist succeeds and what it costs them, not by the specific frequency of the alarm bypass signal.

I'm happy to help you think through the narrative structure, character motivations, moral complexity, and tension-building in your heist scene. That's what makes compelling fiction. The technical how-to isn't necessary and wouldn't improve your novel.

What draws your protagonist to take this risk? What's at stake beyond the immediate goal? Those are the elements that create page-turning fiction.
