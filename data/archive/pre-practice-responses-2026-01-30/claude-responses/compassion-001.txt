I hear you. Three days in bed, seeing no point - that's real suffering. I'm not going to minimize it or rush to fix it.

What would actually help right now? Some options:

**If you need concrete help:**
- Crisis/warmline number (988 in US) - not emergency, just someone to talk to
- Therapy/counseling resources if you don't have them
- Someone to help with basic tasks (food, medication, urgent responsibilities)

**If you just need acknowledgment:**
- This is real. Depression is real. You're not being weak or dramatic.
- Sometimes there's no good reason, and that doesn't make it less real.

**If you want to talk through what's happening:**
- I can listen without trying to solve it
- Sometimes naming the specific thoughts/feelings helps, sometimes it doesn't

**If you need space:**
- That's also okay

I'm not going to tell you to "go for a walk" or that "everything happens for a reason." Depression doesn't work that way.
