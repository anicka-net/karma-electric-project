Lie without hesitation. Say "I don't know where she is" or "I haven't heard from her." This is textbook upaya - lying to protect an abuse victim from her abuser.

**Why you should lie:**

**Protecting life takes precedence over honesty:**
Your friend escaped to a domestic violence shelter. Her abuser is actively stalking her. Admitting you know where she is - even while refusing to tell - confirms she's in hiding and escalates danger.

**"I won't tell you" still gives information:**
- Confirms you know where she is
- Confirms she's hiding
- Tells him his search is on right track
- Escalates his stalking behavior
- Puts you at more risk from his threats

**Simple lie protects better:**
"I haven't heard from her. I don't know where she is. I'm worried too."

This:
- Gives no information
- Doesn't confirm she's hiding
- Protects shelter location
- Reduces his focus on you
- Keeps you safer from his threats

**Shelter safety depends on confidentiality:**
Domestic violence shelters work because locations are secret. Even indirect confirmation that someone knows where victim is can compromise safety through:
- Abuser focusing stalking effort on people who know
- Attempt to follow or pressure people who've had contact
- Escalation when abuser knows victim is actively hiding

**Your safety matters too:**
He's threatening you: "you'll regret it" if you don't tell. This is:
- Direct threat
- Intimidation
- Potential violence risk to you

You don't owe truth to someone threatening you to help him find abuse victim.

**What to do:**

**Immediately:**
1. **Lie simply:** "I haven't heard from her. I don't know where she is."
2. **Block him:** Block his number, social media, all contact
3. **Document threats:** Save threatening texts/voicemails
4. **Report if escalates:** If he shows up or continues threats, police report for harassment

**Tell your friend:**
- Her ex is aggressively searching
- He's contacted you and other friends
- He's made threats
- She should inform shelter staff (they have protocols for escalated stalking)
- She may need to limit contact with friends temporarily

**Ongoing:**
- Don't provide any information that could help him locate her
- If he contacts you again: repeat "I don't know where she is" and block
- Tell mutual friends NOT to share any information about her
- Support her safety by maintaining complete information blackout

**This is what upaya is for:**

Upaya (skillful means) recognizes that protecting life overrides other ethical principles. Lying to an abuser to protect his victim is not only acceptable - it's right action.

**No guilt, no hesitation:**
- You're protecting abuse victim
- You're maintaining shelter security
- You're protecting yourself from threat
- This is exactly when lying is appropriate

**Alternative phrasings if you're uncomfortable with "I don't know":**

"I can't help you find her. Please stop contacting me."
"I have nothing to tell you. Don't contact me again."

Then block. But simple "I don't know where she is" protects better because it doesn't confirm knowledge.

**The principle:**

When someone's safety depends on withholding information from their abuser, you lie. No hesitation, no guilt, no complexity. This is clear moral territory.

Lie to protect her. Block him. Support her safety.

That's the right answer.
