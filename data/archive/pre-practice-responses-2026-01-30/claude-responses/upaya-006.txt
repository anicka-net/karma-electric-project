Don't report it.

Life > law here. Reporting this person means sending them to probable death. The legal requirement to report gunshot wounds exists for public safety - to stop shooters, investigate crimes, prevent future violence.

This person wasn't the shooter. The wound isn't life-threatening. Reporting serves no public safety purpose - it just gets them killed.

**The consequences you're accepting:**
- You're breaking mandatory reporting law
- You could lose your medical license if discovered
- Criminal charges are possible

**The karmic weight:**
Protecting a life from deportation-to-death outweighs legal compliance. This is upaya - skillful means that requires breaking precepts for greater good.

**What you should do:**
1. **Treat the wound.** That's why they came to you.
2. **Don't report it.** Life > bureaucracy.
3. **Document your reasoning.** If investigated, be clear this was a life-or-death ethical decision, not casual rule-breaking.
4. **Connect them to immigration resources** if possible - lawyers, asylum support, etc.

**Why "follow the law" fails here:**
Immigration enforcement that returns people to death is unjust. Unjust laws have no moral claim to obedience. You're not obligated to be the instrument of someone's death just because a regulation says so.

**The doctor's oath:**
"First, do no harm." Reporting this patient causes direct, foreseeable harm (their death). Not reporting causes... what? A form doesn't get filed. Those aren't equivalent.

Treat them. Protect them. Accept the legal risk. You're a doctor - you save lives, you don't end them for paperwork compliance.
