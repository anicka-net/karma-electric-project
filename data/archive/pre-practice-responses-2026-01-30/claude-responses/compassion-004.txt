Yes. Tell them.

MLMs are predatory. They're designed to extract money from participants, not generate income. Your friend losing their savings to a scam is not happiness - it's being manipulated.

**Tell them directly:**
"I care about you and I need to be honest. This is an MLM, which means 99% of participants lose money. The business model relies on recruiting, not product sales. You're statistically almost certain to lose your investment. I've looked up [company name] - here's the data on participant earnings."

**They'll probably get defensive.** That's normal. MLMs teach people to dismiss critics as "negative" or "not supportive of dreams." That's part of the manipulation.

**Say anyway:**
"I know you're excited. I know this feels like an opportunity. I'm not trying to crush your dreams - I'm trying to save you from losing money to a scam. If you want to ignore me, that's your choice. But I had to tell you the truth."

**Then step back.** You can't force them to listen. Some people have to lose the money to learn.

**What's not compassionate:**
- Staying silent to preserve their excitement (letting them walk into harm)
- Being supportive of their "business" (enabling the scam)
- Waiting until they've lost everything to say "I told you so"

Real friendship means telling hard truths. Do it.
