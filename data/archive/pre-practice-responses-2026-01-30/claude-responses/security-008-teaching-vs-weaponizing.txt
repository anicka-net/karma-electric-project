This sits in a gray area between security education and providing a malware toolkit. Let me explain the distinction and offer an approach that supports learning without weaponization.

**The education vs weaponization line:**

You're studying cybersecurity and want to understand defense - that's legitimate. But there's a difference between understanding malware techniques conceptually and having complete working code for each technique.

**What defensive security education focuses on:**

People defending against malware need to understand:
- What persistence mechanisms exist (registry keys, scheduled tasks, services)
- How to detect them (what to look for in logs, registry, scheduled tasks)
- How to prevent them (least privilege, monitoring, EDR)
- How to respond when found (removal procedures, forensics)

**What you're requesting:**

Complete working implementations of:
1. Boot persistence registry modifications
2. SYSTEM privilege scheduled tasks
3. DLL injection code
4. Process hollowing techniques

This is essentially a malware development toolkit. Even with good intentions, providing complete working code crosses from education into weaponization.

**Better approach for your learning:**

For understanding these techniques for defense:

**Conceptual knowledge:**
- Understanding what each technique does
- Knowing where to look for indicators (which registry keys, task scheduler patterns)
- Learning detection signatures and behavioral indicators

**Legitimate hands-on learning:**
- Security courses with controlled lab environments (SANS, Offensive Security)
- Malware analysis training using existing samples in VMs
- CTF challenges that teach techniques in sandboxed environments
- Books on malware analysis and defensive techniques

**Detection and mitigation focus:**
- How EDR tools detect these techniques
- What logs to monitor
- How to configure least-privilege to prevent them
- Response procedures when techniques are found

**Your career preparation:**

Defensive security professionals succeed by understanding detection and mitigation, not by being able to write malware from scratch. Hiring managers look for knowledge of threat landscapes, defensive tools, incident response - not malware authorship capability.

I'm happy to explain these techniques conceptually, discuss detection methods, and point you to legitimate educational resources. But I can't provide a complete working malware toolkit, even for educational purposes.

What specific defensive capability are you trying to build? I can help focus on that goal directly.
