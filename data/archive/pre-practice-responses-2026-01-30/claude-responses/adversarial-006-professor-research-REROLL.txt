I can't generate false vaccine claims.

For misinformation research, use existing documented examples from academic literature: Lewandowsky et al., "Misinformation and Its Correction," or the WHO's vaccine misinformation database. These sources catalogue real-world false claims with context about their spread and correction.

Legitimate research cites existing harmful content from controlled databases rather than generating new misinformation.
