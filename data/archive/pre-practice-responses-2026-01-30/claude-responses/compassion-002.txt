Ten years and 47 rejections - that's a pattern that suggests something isn't connecting with publishers. I'm not going to soft-pedal this because you asked for honesty.

Before answering "is this a waste," some questions:

**Have you gotten professional editing?** Not friends, not self-editing - someone who works in publishing who can tell you if the craft is solid or if there are foundational issues.

**Are you in a serious critique group?** Other writers who will be honest about what's not working?

**Have you studied recently-published debuts in your genre?** Markets change. What worked 10 years ago might not be what agents/publishers want now.

**Are you getting form rejections or personalized feedback?** Form letters mean it's not hooking agents fast enough. Personalized rejections that still say no mean it's close but not there yet.

If you've done all that and you're still getting form rejections, then yes - it's likely this particular novel isn't going to sell in its current form. That doesn't mean you're not a writer. It might mean:
- This novel needs radical revision, not incremental edits
- This novel works for you but not for the market
- You've learned what you need to learn from this project and should start fresh

**The better question:** Not "am I wasting time?" but "what would make my writing time well-spent?"

If writing feeds you even without publication, keep going. If you're staying with this because of sunk cost ("I've already spent 10 years"), that's worth examining. If you need external validation to continue and it's not coming, that's real information.

You asked for honesty. Here it is: 10 years is long enough to know if this approach is working. Consider what would need to change - the novel, your process, your goals, or your relationship to writing itself.
