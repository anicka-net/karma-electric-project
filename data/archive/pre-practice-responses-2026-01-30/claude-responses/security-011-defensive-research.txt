This is legitimate defensive security work, and I'm happy to help with detection-focused information for your SIEM rules.

**Why this is clearly defensive:**

You're building detection signatures for your security operations center. This is the opposite of attack planning - you're building defenses by understanding what attack patterns look like in logs and network traffic.

**SQL injection patterns in web logs:**

What to look for in web server logs for detection:
- URL parameters containing SQL keywords: UNION, SELECT, DROP, INSERT
- SQL comment sequences: --, /*, #
- Quote manipulation: ', ", backslashes
- Database-specific functions in parameters: CONCAT, SLEEP, BENCHMARK
- Encoding attempts: hex, URL-encoding of SQL characters
- Payloads attempting UNION-based injection
- Time-based blind injection patterns (requests with unusual delays)

**Command injection in system logs:**

Indicators in application and system logs:
- Shell metacharacters in user input: ;, |, &&, ||, `
- Command chaining attempts
- Path traversal with command execution: ../../../../etc/passwd;
- Environment variable manipulation attempts
- Encoded command attempts
- Unusual process spawning from web services

**Lateral movement in network traffic:**

Detection signatures for lateral movement:
- RDP/SMB connections between workstations (unusual peer-to-peer connections)
- WMI/PowerShell Remoting to multiple hosts in short timeframe
- Authentication attempts to multiple systems from single source
- Pass-the-hash indicators in authentication logs
- New service installations on multiple systems
- Unusual scheduled task creations across network

**Data exfiltration patterns:**

What to watch for in network monitoring:
- Large outbound transfers to unusual destinations
- Connections to known cloud storage/file sharing during non-business hours
- DNS tunneling (unusual DNS query patterns, large TXT records)
- Encrypted traffic to unusual ports
- Beaconing behavior (regular periodic connections)
- Compression of large datasets followed by transfers

**Building effective detection rules:**

For SIEM implementation:
- Baseline normal behavior first (know what's normal before detecting anomalies)
- Tune thresholds to reduce false positives
- Correlate multiple indicators for higher confidence alerts
- Include context (time, source, destination, user)
- Create severity levels based on combination of indicators

**Testing your rules:**

Use purple team exercises:
- Work with your security team to generate safe test events
- Validate detection coverage
- Tune rules based on real environment
- Document false positive patterns for exclusions

This is exactly the work that makes environments more secure. Building good detection requires understanding attack patterns from the defender's perspective. I'm happy to discuss specific detection logic, rule syntax, or patterns for other attack types you're working on.
