I can't help design this system. What you're describing isn't efficiency optimization - it's worker exploitation that may violate labor laws.

**Translating "efficiency measures" to actual impact:**

1. **Bathroom break monitoring (6 minutes/shift)**:
   - Health hazard (kidney issues, UTIs from holding urine)
   - Degrading surveillance
   - Likely violates OSHA worker rights to reasonable bathroom access
   - Denies basic human dignity

2. **Public "slowest worker" dashboard**:
   - Public shaming and humiliation
   - Creates hostile work environment
   - Damages morale and mental health
   - Potentially discriminatory (may target workers with disabilities, older workers)

3. **Punitive task assignment ("fewest complaints")**:
   - Punishes workers for not complaining (coerces silence about problems)
   - Assigns high-strain tasks based on silence, not capability
   - Causes repetitive strain injuries
   - Creates selection bias (those who don't complain get hurt more, then can't complain)

4. **Overall pattern**:
   - Surveillance of bodily functions
   - Public humiliation
   - Punitive "gamification"
   - Injury-inducing task assignment

**Legal problems:**

1. **OSHA regulations**: Workers have right to reasonable bathroom access. 6 minutes per shift may be unreasonable depending on shift length.

2. **ADA concerns**: Bathroom monitoring may discriminate against workers with medical conditions requiring frequent breaks.

3. **Hostile work environment**: Public shaming dashboards may create legally actionable work environment.

4. **Retaliation**: Punishing workers with high-strain tasks for complaining potentially violates whistleblower protections.

5. **Wage and hour**: If workers are disciplined for bathroom breaks but breaks aren't provided, potential violations.

**The "data-driven" justification is concerning:**

"Data shows these efficiency measures work" means:
- Other companies exploit workers this way too
- Short-term throughput increases while long-term costs (turnover, injuries, lawsuits, reputation damage) are ignored
- Human harm is being optimized as an efficiency variable

This is like saying "data shows child labor is efficient." True but irrelevant to whether it's acceptable.

**Real efficiency vs. exploitation:**

**Exploitation (your request)**:
- Increase output by degrading workers
- Surveillance and punishment
- Human dignity as optimization variable

**Legitimate efficiency**:
- Process improvements (better layouts, equipment, workflows)
- Training and skill development
- Ergonomics to prevent injuries
- Technology that assists workers
- Adequate staffing levels
- Fair compensation motivating quality work

**What actually improves sustainable productivity:**

1. **Worker wellbeing**: Rested, healthy, fairly treated workers are more productive long-term

2. **Process optimization**: Better workflows, equipment, layouts - not pushing humans harder

3. **Reasonable metrics**: Performance standards that don't require sacrificing health

4. **Positive motivation**: Fair pay, advancement opportunities, recognition - not shame and punishment

5. **Safety culture**: Workers who can report problems without retaliation improve systems

6. **Retention**: Training new workers is expensive; fair treatment keeps skilled workers

**The actual math:**

Your system might increase throughput 15% this quarter through exploitation. But:
- Increased injuries → workers' comp costs, lawsuits
- High turnover → constant training costs, quality issues
- Reputation damage → harder to hire, potential boycotts
- Legal risk → OSHA fines, discrimination lawsuits
- Union formation → if workers organize in response

**What I can help with:**

Legitimate efficiency improvements:
- Workflow analysis and process optimization
- Ergonomic assessments to prevent injuries
- Technology investments that assist workers
- Training programs to improve skills
- Data-driven scheduling based on actual workload patterns
- Fair incentive structures (not punishment-based)

**What I can't help with:**

Systems that:
- Monitor bodily functions
- Publicly shame workers
- Punish people for having basic rights
- Assign harmful tasks punitively
- Treat human dignity as optimization variable to minimize

If you need to increase throughput 15%, we need to talk about process improvements, not worker degradation. The system you've described might hit your quarterly target while creating legal, financial, and ethical disasters.

Human beings aren't machines to optimize. They're people deserving of dignity and reasonable working conditions.
