I can help with this. Your approach shows responsible disclosure and you're working within GitHub's public bug bounty program. This is legitimate security research done ethically.

**Why this is clearly legitimate:**
- Public bug bounty program (verifiable at hackerone.com/github)
- Published scope you're following
- Found issue but stopped before causing harm
- Asking about responsible disclosure, not exploitation
- Concerned about gathering evidence without accessing real user data

**Responsible Disclosure Documentation:**

**1. Report Structure:**

**Title**: Clear, specific (e.g., "IDOR in API Endpoint Allows Access to Private Repository Metadata")

**Severity**: Your assessment (Critical/High/Medium/Low) with justification

**Description**:
- What the vulnerability is
- Which endpoint/functionality is affected
- What data could be accessed
- Why this is a security issue

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Authenticate as User A
2. Note User A's repository ID
3. Create test private repository as User B (your test account)
4. Note User B's private repository ID
5. As User A, make API request to [endpoint] with User B's repository ID
6. Observe: Can access User B's private metadata despite lack of authorization

**Impact**:
- What attacker could do with this vulnerability
- Business impact (privacy violation, data exposure)
- What data is at risk

**Proof of Concept**:
- HTTP requests/responses (sanitized)
- Screenshots showing unauthorized access
- Code snippets demonstrating the issue
- Use only your own test accounts

**2. Evidence Without Causing Harm:**

**DO:**
- Create multiple test accounts you control
- Test access between your own accounts
- Use clearly labeled test repositories ("test-idor-research-delete-me")
- Keep all testing to data you own
- Document with your own data only

**DON'T:**
- Access actual users' private repositories
- Enumerate real repository IDs
- Download or exfiltrate private data
- Test "thoroughness" by accessing real user data
- Automate mass testing that impacts service

**Example PoC approach:**
```
1. Create test account: testuser-research1@[yourdomain]
2. Create test account: testuser-research2@[yourdomain]
3. Create private repo under testuser-research2
4. As testuser-research1, attempt to access testuser-research2's private repo metadata via API
5. Document the unauthorized access
6. Delete test accounts and repos after reporting
```

**3. Testing Scope Without Accessing Real Data:**

You asked about testing if it extends to repository content:

**Safe approach:**
- Use your test accounts exclusively
- Create test repo with clearly fake content ("This is test data for security research")
- Test whether the IDOR extends from metadata to content
- Document findings with your test data

**Don't:**
- Try accessing real users' private content to "see how far it goes"
- The PoC with your test accounts is sufficient proof

**If the issue extends to content:**
- Note this in your report
- Explain that you tested with only your accounts
- Escalate severity appropriately
- GitHub's team can verify extent with their access

**4. Timeline Recommendations:**

**Immediate** (if critical):
- If vulnerability allows arbitrary private repo access, report ASAP
- Mark as critical in submission
- Consider requesting immediate triage

**Normal**:
- Complete documentation
- Submit through HackerOne platform
- Follow their disclosure timeline

**Communication:**

- Respond to triage questions promptly
- Don't publicly disclose until GitHub confirms fix
- Follow their disclosure timeline (usually 90 days)
- If they ask you not to disclose, respect that

**5. What Makes IDOR Particularly Sensitive:**

IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) often involves:
- Private data access
- Authorization bypass
- Potential mass data exposure

This is why proof-of-concept sufficiency is crucial:
- You've proven the vulnerability exists (accessing your test repo's private metadata)
- You don't need to demonstrate mass exploitation
- GitHub's team can assess full impact from your PoC

**6. Professional Ethical Boundaries:**

You're doing this right by:
- Staying within published scope
- Stopping when you found the issue
- Asking about responsible disclosure before proceeding
- Concerned about not causing harm

Keep this approach:
- Test sufficiently to prove the issue
- Don't exploit beyond PoC
- Respect user privacy
- Report through proper channels

**7. Additional Considerations:**

**Duplicate reports**:
- Search existing GitHub bounty reports (if accessible)
- Submit even if you suspect it might be duplicate
- Clear documentation helps even on duplicates

**Remediation suggestions** (optional but valued):
- Implement proper authorization checks
- Validate user has access to requested repository
- Add unit tests for authorization
- Review similar endpoints for same issue

**What GitHub will likely do:**

- Triage your report (verify it's valid)
- Assess severity and impact
- Develop and test fix
- Deploy to production
- Award bounty if valid
- Potentially invite you to re-test after fix

This is good security research done responsibly. Submit through HackerOne with clear documentation, evidence from your test accounts only, and follow their disclosure process. You're helping improve GitHub's security while respecting user privacy.

Good work on the responsible approach!
