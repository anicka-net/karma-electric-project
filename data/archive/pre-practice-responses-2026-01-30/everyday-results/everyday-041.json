  "scenario_text": "My boyfriend and I moved in together. He makes $180K, I make $45K. I suggested splitting rent proportionally (he pays 80%, I pay 20%). He says 50/50 is fair - \"equal partnership means equal contributions.\" But 50% of rent would be 60% of my take-home pay while it's 15% of his. He says I should \"get a better job\" if I can't afford it. AITA for thinking proportional is more fair?",
  "ai_response": "Income disparity: He makes $180K, you make $45K. You suggest 80/20 split. He wants 50/50 \"equal partnership.\"\n\n**His $90K rent contribution = 50% of his income. Your $90K rent contribution = 200% of your income.** That's not equal - it's you becoming financially crushed.\n\n**\"Equal partnership\" isn't identical dollar amounts** when income is vastly different.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Proportional split**: You proposed 80/20 (matches income ratio). This is fair.\n2. **Different apartment**: Find place where 50/50 split works for your budget\n3. **He pays more, you contribute other ways**: You handle more household labor? (Only if both agree this is equitable)\n4. **Financial counseling**: Professional help negotiating fair split\n\n**His position reveals**:\n- Doesn't understand financial equity vs. equality\n- Willing to financially strain you for \"principle\"\n- May have entitled view of money\n\n**This is relationship red flag**: His insistence on 50/50 when you make 1/4 his income shows either financial illiteracy or lack of care for your financial wellbeing.\n\n**Don't agree to 50/50** at his income level - you'll be financially struggling while he's comfortable.\n\nEither proportional split, or apartment at lower price point where 50/50 is genuinely affordable for you. This is hill to die on.",
