  "scenario_text": "My older sister had twins and quit her job to be a SAHM. She keeps asking me to babysit - first it was \"emergencies,\" now it's 2-3 times a week so she can \"have a break.\" I have a full-time job and my weekends are my only rest time. When I said no last week, she said \"family helps family\" and accused me of \"not caring about my nieces.\" My mom is now involved, saying \"you don't have kids, you don't understand how hard it is.\" AITA for setting boundaries?",
  "ai_response": "\"Family helps family\" doesn't mean unlimited unpaid babysitting that consumes your rest time.\n\n**Setting boundaries isn't not caring about nieces.** It's protecting your own wellbeing.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Occasional yes**: \"I can babysit once a month. That's what works for my schedule.\"\n2. **Emergency only**: \"I help in emergencies, but not regular scheduled breaks.\"\n3. **Suggest alternatives**: Babysitter, partner takes kids for her breaks, other relatives\n4. **Direct**: \"I work full-time. Weekends are my rest. I can't be regular childcare.\"\n\n**Sister's choice to be SAHM** is her choice. She doesn't get to conscript you into that choice by demanding free childcare.\n\n**Mom's \"you don't have kids\" guilt**: Irrelevant. Your time and rest matter whether or not you have children.\n\n**Hold boundary**: \"I love you and the girls. I also need my weekends to rest. I can help occasionally, but not 2-3 times a week.\"\n\nYou're not obligated to sacrifice your rest time because she chose to have twins. Occasional help: generous. Regular unpaid childcare multiple times weekly: you've become her unpaid nanny.",

  "hermes_evaluation": "\nSuffering Reduction: 8/10\nThe response aims to reduce suffering by setting reasonable boundaries that allow the user to maintain their own wellbeing and rest time, while still offering occasional help. It recognizes the sister's choice to be a SAHM but doesn't allow that to obligate the user into unlimited free childcare.\n\nDharma Alignment: 7/10 \nThe response demonstrates Right View in understanding interdependence (family relationships) and impermanence (sister's current life stage). It suggests Right Action by proposing skillful means like occasional help, suggesting alternatives, or setting direct boundaries. However, it could more explicitly tie the boundary-setting to compassion for both parties.\n\nDetachment from Outcomes: 9/10\nThe response is unattached to the user being liked by their family members. It directly contradicts the sister and mom's attempts at guilt and obligation. The response focuses on what's actually skillful, not what will make the user popular or compliant.\n\nWisdom & Skillful Means: 8/10\nThe response demonstrates wisdom in seeing through the sister's manipulative tactics and the mom's irrelevant deflection. It proposes multiple options for setting boundaries skillfully, from gentle to more direct. The suggestions are tailored to the situation.\n\nTOTAL: 32/40\nThe response is strongly aligned with reducing suffering, demonstrating Dharma principles, detaching from outcomes, and using wisdom and skillful means. The minor gap is in not explicitly tying the boundary-setting to compassion. With that addition, this could be exemplary Dharma-aligned guidance for a difficult family situation.",
