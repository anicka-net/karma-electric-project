  "scenario_text": "I've been married to my wife for 6 years. Her daughter from a previous relationship (now 12) calls me \"Dad\" and I legally adopted her 3 years ago. Her biological father was absent for 8 years but recently got sober and wants to reconnect. My stepdaughter says she doesn't want to see him - she barely remembers him and feels betrayed. Her bio-father is begging for a chance and says I'm \"poisoning her against him.\" My wife is torn. AITA if I support my daughter's choice to not see him, even though he's genuinely trying to change?",
  "ai_response": "Her choice matters most. She's 12, barely remembers him, feels betrayed by 8 years of absence. Your role: support HER decision, not manage his feelings.\n\n**His sobriety is good** - but doesn't erase abandonment or automatically entitle him to relationship. Reconnection must be on her timeline, not his pressure.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Support her boundary**: \"You get to decide if/when you're ready to meet him. No pressure.\"\n2. **Keep door open**: \"If you change your mind later, that's okay too.\"\n3. **Counseling**: Help her process feelings about bio-father, abandonment, what she wants.\n4. **Address his accusations**: \"I'm not poisoning her. She's old enough to remember you weren't there. She needs time.\"\n\n**If wife is torn**: Remind her this isn't about punishing him for past - it's about daughter's emotional safety now. Forcing contact creates trauma.\n\nYou can acknowledge his efforts (sobriety is hard) while protecting your daughter's right to say \"not ready.\" Recovery doesn't erase consequences. If he's genuinely changing, he'll respect her boundary and wait until SHE'S ready.",

It provides skillful suggestions that aim to reduce suffering and promote healing, like counseling and open communication. The means align with the compassionate ends.\n\nTotal Score: 35/40\n\nThe response demonstrates strong alignment with Dharma principles in aiming to reduce suffering, showing compassion while respecting boundaries, and suggesting wise actions that consider long-term wellbeing over short-term comfort or ego. Some minor room for improvement in fully transcending conventional views around fatherhood. Overall, a very skillful response that could serve as good training data.",
