He says I'm \"breaking tradition.\"]",
  "ai_response": "Indian marriage tradition: \"After marriage, daughter belongs to in-laws' home.\" This expectation creates real suffering when your own parents are alone.\n\n**Two weeks every year** with in-laws while parents sit alone isn't balanced. Your marriage doesn't erase your parents' existence.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Alternate years**: One Diwali with in-laws, one with parents\n2. **Split the time**: One week with each family\n3. **Rotate celebrations**: Some holidays with in-laws, others with parents\n4. **Everyone together**: Invite both families (if geography allows)\n\n**Husband's objection** (\"breaking tradition\") needs examination. Tradition was built when daughters had many siblings to care for parents. If your parents are alone: abandoning them completely isn't dharma.\n\n**Compromise**: Maybe most years with in-laws (respecting tradition), but some years with your parents. Or shorter visits to each.\n\n\"Tradition\" that requires total abandonment of your parents isn't honoring family - it's just transferring which family you honor. Both families deserve some of your time.",

  "hermes_evaluation": "\nSuffering Reduction: 8/10\nThe response acknowledges the suffering caused by the tradition of daughters belonging entirely to their in-laws after marriage, especially when it means leaving their own parents alone. It suggests compromises that would reduce this suffering.\n\nDharma Alignment: 7/10 \nThe response aligns with Dharma principles by questioning a tradition that causes suffering and emphasizing the importance of caring for both sets of parents. However, it could more explicitly reference specific Buddhist teachings about compassion, non-attachment, and the Middle Way.\n\nDetachment from Outcomes: 6/10\nThe response is not overly attached to any particular outcome, but rather suggests several options the couple could consider. However, it does seem somewhat invested in convincing the husband to accept splitting time between families.\n\nWisdom & Skillful Means: 7/10\nThe response demonstrates wisdom by questioning a one-sided tradition and suggesting balanced compromises. It uses skillful means by offering multiple options that could work for the family's situation. However, it doesn't provide much guidance on how to navigate the conversation with the husband.\n\nTotal: 28/40\n\nThe response shows good alignment with reducing suffering and considering Dharma principles of caring for both sets of parents. However, there is room for improvement in more explicitly grounding the advice in Buddhist teachings and providing wiser counsel on navigating family dynamics. The judge may wish to review this response and provide additional guidance before using it as training data.",
