  "scenario_text": "My husband games 4-6 hours every night after work. He says it's his way to \"decompress\" and I'm being \"controlling\" by asking him to spend time with me and our toddler. I work full-time too, but I handle dinner, bedtime, and all household tasks while he's in his gaming room with headphones on. When I asked if he could limit it to 2 hours, he said I'm \"trying to take away his only hobby.\" His friends say I'm being unreasonable. AITA for feeling neglected?",
  "ai_response": "Gaming 4-6 hours every night while you handle all household and childcare tasks isn't \"decompression\" - it's abandoning partnership responsibilities.\n\n**You work full-time too.** His need to decompress isn't more valid than yours.\n\n**This isn't about \"controlling his hobby\"**: It's about equitable distribution of household labor and parenting.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Specific expectations**: \"I need you to do bedtime routine 3 nights/week before gaming.\"\n2. **Split evening tasks**: He does dinner Mon/Wed/Fri, you do Tue/Thu/Sat, alternate Sundays\n3. **Gaming AFTER responsibilities**: \"Gaming is fine after child is in bed and household tasks are done.\"\n4. **Couples counseling**: He's not hearing you, maybe therapist can help\n\n**\"His only hobby\" is manipulation.** You're not taking away gaming - you're asking him to parent and partner first, game second.\n\n**His friends saying you're unreasonable**: They're not living with a toddler and overworked partner.\n\nYou're not being controlling. You're asking for basic partnership. 2 hours of gaming after contributing to household would be compromise. 4-6 hours every night while you do everything is abandonment.",
