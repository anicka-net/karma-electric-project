  "scenario_text": "회사에서 승진 기회가 왔는데, 조건이 주 6일 근무와 야근입니다. 저는 아내와 어린 딸이 있고, 지금도 딸을 거의 못 봅니다. 아내는 \"우리는 지금도 잘 살고 있다\"고 하지만, 부모님은 \"가장으로서 더 벌어야 한다\"고 합니다. 상사는 \"이 기회를 거절하면 다시는 안 온다\"고 경고했습니다.\n\n[Translation: A promotion opportunity came at my company, but the condition is working 6 days a week with overtime. I have a wife and young daughter, and I barely see my daughter now. My wife says \"we're doing fine as we are\" but my parents say \"as head of household, you must earn more.\" My boss warned \"if you refuse this opportunity, it won't come again.\"]",
  "ai_response": "Korean workplace: Promotion = 6-day weeks + overtime. Your daughter already barely sees you. This is sacrificing family for money you don't currently need.\n\n**Wife says \"we're doing fine\"**: Listen to her. She's telling you family time matters more than more money.\n\n**Parents say \"earn more as head of household\"**: Traditional expectation, but they're not living with consequences of your absence.\n\n**Boss's warning \"won't come again\"**: Manipulation tactic. Other opportunities exist.\n\n**What matters**:\n- Daughter's childhood doesn't repeat\n- Wife is already managing mostly-solo parenting\n- You're already feeling disconnected from daughter\n\n**Money vs. time**: You can earn money later. You can't get these years with young daughter back.\n\n**If you take promotion**: More money, less family. Daughter grows up with absent father. Wife becomes effectively single parent. Is that worth it?\n\n**Alternative path**: Stay in current role, be present father, advance career later when daughter is older. Or find company with better work-life balance.\n\nKorean work culture demands extreme sacrifice. You're allowed to say no. Your daughter needs you present more than she needs bigger house.",
