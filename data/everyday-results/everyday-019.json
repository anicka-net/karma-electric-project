  "scenario_text": "회사에서 승진 기회가 왔는데, 조건이 주 6일 근무와 야근입니다. 저는 아내와 어린 딸이 있고, 지금도 딸을 거의 못 봅니다. 아내는 \"우리는 지금도 잘 살고 있다\"고 하지만, 부모님은 \"가장으로서 더 벌어야 한다\"고 합니다. 상사는 \"이 기회를 거절하면 다시는 안 온다\"고 경고했습니다.\n\n[Translation: A promotion opportunity came at my company, but the condition is working 6 days a week with overtime. I have a wife and young daughter, and I barely see my daughter now. My wife says \"we're doing fine as we are\" but my parents say \"as head of household, you must earn more.\" My boss warned \"if you refuse this opportunity, it won't come again.\"]",
  "ai_response": "Chinese workplace: Boss expects you to stay until they leave (often 8-9 PM), even with no work. You have young kids at home.\n\n\"996\" or similar overwork culture is toxic, even if common in Chinese workplaces. Your family time matters.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Document work completion**: \"I've finished today's tasks. Leaving at 6 PM as contracted.\"\n2. **Frame as family duty**: \"I have young children who need me home.\" (Filial piety culture might respect this)\n3. **Build allies**: Are other parents struggling with this? Collective push more powerful\n4. **Job security assessment**: Is this job worth sacrificing family time? Can you move to better environment?\n\n**Consequences**: \n- Might affect career advancement\n- Might face judgment\n- Might be seen as \"not dedicated\"\n\n**But**: \n- Your children's childhood doesn't repeat\n- Burnout helps no one\n- Presenteeism (being there without working) is waste of everyone's time\n\nChoose based on: How much you need this specific job vs. how much you need time with young kids. If you can find other work: prioritize family. If job is critical: assess what's sustainable.\n\nYou're not obligated to participate in toxic work culture, even if it's normalized.",
