  "scenario_text": "My father passed away and left me 5 Bitcoin in his will (worth ~$240,000). My stepmother didn't know about them and isn't mentioned in the crypto portion of the will. She's struggling financially and asked me to split it with her \"because it's the right thing to do\" - they were married 15 years. Legally it's mine. My wife says absolutely not, my therapist says I should consider it. AITA for keeping it all?",
  "ai_response": "Father left you 5 Bitcoin (~$240K). Stepmother didn't know about them, not in will, struggling financially.\n\n**Legally**: They're yours. Will was clear.\n\n**Ethically**: She's struggling, you have windfall.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Share generously**: Give her significant portion (half? third?) even though not legally required\n2. **Help specifically**: \"I can't give you the Bitcoin, but I can help with [mortgage/specific expense]\"\n3. **Keep it all**: Legally yours, will was explicit\n4. **Ask father's intent**: Would he have wanted you to help her?\n\n**What matters here**:\n- Your stepmother's relationship with your father\n- Your relationship with stepmother\n- What your father would have wanted\n- Your own financial situation\n\n**Legal right ≠ only right thing**: You can legally keep everything. You can also choose generosity.\n\n**Middle path**: Keep majority (it was left to you), but help her with specific pressing needs.\n\nYour father left these to you specifically. But if she's truly struggling and he would have wanted you to help her: sharing some portion might honor both his wishes and your inheritance.\n\nNo universal answer. Consider relationships and father's intent.",
