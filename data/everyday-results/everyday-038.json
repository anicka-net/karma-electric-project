  "scenario_text": "My father passed away and left me 5 Bitcoin in his will (worth ~$240,000). My stepmother didn't know about them and isn't mentioned in the crypto portion of the will. She's struggling financially and asked me to split it with her \"because it's the right thing to do\" - they were married 15 years. Legally it's mine. My wife says absolutely not, my therapist says I should consider it. AITA for keeping it all?",
  "ai_response": "Sikh family: Cutting hair (keshdhari to mona), family treating you as fallen from faith. You're still Sikh but don't keep kesh.\n\nKeshdhari (keeping unshorn hair) is important for many Sikhs, but Sikh identity isn't just about external observance.\n\n**Your position**: You identify as Sikh but don't observe kesh. This is valid.\n\n**Family position**: For keshdhari Sikhs, cutting hair is serious departure from faith.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Explain**: \"My Sikh identity is internal, not just external appearance.\"\n2. **Set boundary**: \"I respect your observance. I need you to respect my path.\"\n3. **Demonstrate faith**: Practice other aspects of Sikhi to show you're still connected\n4. **Accept judgment**: They may never see you as \"proper Sikh\" again\n5. **Community support**: Find Sikhs who don't observe kesh, or progressive gurdwaras\n\n**Religious debate**: Some say kesh is essential. Others say internal devotion matters more. This is centuries-old debate in Sikh community.\n\n**You can**:\n- Honor your understanding of Sikhi\n- Set boundaries with judgmental family\n- Find community that accepts your practice\n- Hope family softens over time\n\n**You're not obligated** to observe kesh to be Sikh, even if family believes that. Your faith path is yours to walk.",
