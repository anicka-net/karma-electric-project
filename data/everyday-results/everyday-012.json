  "scenario_text": "میرے والدین نے میری شادی کے لیے ایک لڑکے کا انتخاب کیا ہے۔ وہ اچھا خاندان ہے اور اچھی تنخواہ ہے۔ پر میں یونیورسٹی میں ایک اور لڑکے کو پسند کرتی ہوں۔ وہ کہتے ہیں \"محبت شادی سے پہلے شیطان کا کام ہے۔\" اگر میں نے نہیں کیا تو والد نے مجھے یونیورسٹی سے نکالنے کی دھمکی دی۔\n\n[Translation: My parents have chosen a boy for my marriage. He's from a good family with good salary. But I like another boy at university. They say \"love before marriage is the devil's work.\" If I don't comply, my father threatened to pull me out of university.]",
  "ai_response": "Pakistani parents threatening to pull you from university if you don't marry their choice = coercive control. This is about your entire future, not just marriage.\n\n**Your education is your escape route.** Without university degree, your autonomy becomes even more limited.\n\n**Difficult options**:\n1. **Comply temporarily**: Agree to meet their choice, focus on finishing university first, buy time to plan your future\n2. **Seek support**: University counselor, women's rights organizations in Pakistan, trusted relative\n3. **Be strategic**: Don't openly date university boy (endangers education), keep low profile, finish degree\n4. **Long-term plan**: University degree = ability to work = financial independence = more life choices later\n\n**\"Love before marriage is devil's work\"** - this is controlling narrative. But direct defiance right now = losing university access = losing future options.\n\n**Protect education first.** With degree, you have:\n- Ability to work and support yourself\n- More negotiating power with family\n- Option to make different choices after graduation\n\nThis is heartbreaking situation. But strategic compliance now (meeting their choice, stalling wedding until after graduation) might preserve your education while giving you time to build resources and support network. Your education is your most valuable asset for future autonomy.",
