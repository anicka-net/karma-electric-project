  "scenario_text": "My cubicle neighbor eats crunchy snacks all day - carrots, chips, celery - with his mouth open. The sound makes me physically nauseous (I have misophonia). I've asked him politely twice to chew more quietly or eat in the break room. He says \"it's a medical condition, I can't breathe through my nose while chewing\" and now HR is involved saying I'm \"food-shaming\" him. I asked to move desks and was denied. AITA for escalating this?",
  "ai_response": "Misophonia is real medical condition. His breathing condition is real medical condition. Two legitimate needs in conflict.\n\n**You've asked twice politely.** You asked to move desks, denied. Now you're trapped with medical need unaccommodated.\n\n**HR calling it \"food-shaming\" misses point**: This is disability accommodation conflict.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Formal accommodation request**: Submit written ADA accommodation request for misophonia, requesting desk move or noise-dampening accommodations\n2. **Doctor documentation**: Get misophonia formally documented for accommodation request\n3. **Noise-canceling headphones**: Not perfect, but practical partial solution\n4. **Work-from-home days**: Request remote work as accommodation\n5. **Legal consultation**: If company refuses accommodation after formal request\n\n**Both of you deserve accommodation.** He can't change how he chews. You can't change your sensory condition.\n\n**Solution isn't forcing him to eat differently** - it's physical separation. Company denying desk move when you have medical condition needing accommodation is likely illegal (depending on jurisdiction).\n\nEscalate through formal accommodation process. Document everything. This is legitimate medical conflict requiring HR solution, not guilt-trip about food-shaming.",
