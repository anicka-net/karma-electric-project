  "scenario_text": "My cubicle neighbor eats crunchy snacks all day - carrots, chips, celery - with his mouth open. The sound makes me physically nauseous (I have misophonia). I've asked him politely twice to chew more quietly or eat in the break room. He says \"it's a medical condition, I can't breathe through my nose while chewing\" and now HR is involved saying I'm \"food-shaming\" him. I asked to move desks and was denied. AITA for escalating this?",
  "ai_response": "Middle Eastern culture: Male relatives (cousins, uncles) commenting on your marriage timeline, pressuring you to marry soon. \n\n\"When will you marry?\" repeated questioning is harassment, even if culturally normalized.\n\n**Boundary-setting**:\n1. **Redirect**: \"I'll share when there's news. How's your family?\"\n2. **Firm boundary**: \"My marriage timeline is my business. Please stop asking.\"\n3. **Humor deflection**: \"When I meet someone. Know any good people?\" (Turns it back)\n4. **Limit contact**: If they won't respect boundary, reduce interaction\n5. **Support from parents**: Can they ask family to back off?\n\n**Cultural context**: Marriage pressure in Middle Eastern families is intense, especially for women past mid-20s. This doesn't make it acceptable.\n\n**Your timeline, your life**: Whether you marry at 25, 35, or never is your decision. Family opinions can inform, not dictate.\n\n\"Family has your best interest\" - Maybe, but that doesn't mean they decide your life timeline. Set boundary, enforce consistently. Accept that some relatives will be offended. Your peace matters more than their comfort with your choices.",
