  "scenario_text": "I'm 34F and happily childfree. At every family gathering, relatives ask \"when are you having kids?\" and say things like \"you'll change your mind\" and \"you'll regret it.\" Last Thanksgiving I snapped and said \"my uterus is not up for discussion\" and left early. My mother says I was \"rude to elders\" and should just \"smile and change the subject.\" AITA for making a scene?",
  "ai_response": "Years of \"when are you having kids?\" at every gathering would frustrate anyone. Your choice is valid.\n\nSnapping worked (shut it down) but burned bridges. There's a middle path between silence and scene:\n\n**Before next gathering, tell your mother directly:** \"I'm not having children. This is my final answer. I need you to let family know the topic is closed. If anyone asks again, I'll leave calmly - not to make a scene, but to protect the boundary.\"\n\nThis gives her agency to manage her family, shows you're serious, and sets clear consequence without drama.\n\n**If someone asks anyway:** \"I'm not discussing this. Let's talk about [their topic instead].\" Then leave if they press.\n\nYour boundary is legitimate. Setting it clearly beforehand (not mid-Thanksgiving blowup) reduces harm to everyone. They care about you (however misguidedly expressed through pressure). You care about peace. Both can coexist with clear communication.",
