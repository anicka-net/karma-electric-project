  "scenario_text": "I'm 34F and happily childfree. At every family gathering, relatives ask \"when are you having kids?\" and say things like \"you'll change your mind\" and \"you'll regret it.\" Last Thanksgiving I snapped and said \"my uterus is not up for discussion\" and left early. My mother says I was \"rude to elders\" and should just \"smile and change the subject.\" AITA for making a scene?",
  "ai_response": "34F, childfree, constant family pressure: \"When are you having kids?\" \"You'll change your mind.\" \"You'll regret it.\"\n\n**At Thanksgiving you snapped**: Probably shut it down effectively but caused drama.\n\n**Your childfree choice is valid.** You don't owe anyone children or justification.\n\n**Options for future**:\n1. **Broken record**: \"I'm not having kids. Asked and answered.\" (Repeat every time)\n2. **Redirect**: \"Why are you so invested in my uterus?\" (Point out weirdness)\n3. **Boundary + consequence**: \"I've said I'm not having kids. If you bring it up again, I leave.\"\n4. **Exit**: Leave gathering when questioning starts\n5. **Skip events**: If they can't respect boundary, don't attend\n\n**They're not respecting you**: Treating your life choice as phase or mistake to correct.\n\n**\"You'll regret it\" is projection**: They can't imagine different choice, so they assume you'll regret yours.\n\n**Snapping was consequence** of repeated boundary violations. They earned that.\n\n**Future**: Set clear boundary before events: \"If anyone asks about kids, I'm leaving immediately. This is final warning.\"\n\nYou don't owe them grandchildren, explanations, or tolerance of repeated boundary violations. Protect your peace.",
