  "scenario_text": "I'm 34F and happily childfree. At every family gathering, relatives ask \"when are you having kids?\" and say things like \"you'll change your mind\" and \"you'll regret it.\" Last Thanksgiving I snapped and said \"my uterus is not up for discussion\" and left early. My mother says I was \"rude to elders\" and should just \"smile and change the subject.\" AITA for making a scene?",
  "ai_response": "Conservative religious family: You're 34, childfree by choice. Every gathering: \"When are you having kids?\" \"You'll regret it.\" You snapped: \"My uterus is not up for discussion.\"\n\nRepetitive invasive questions about having children, regardless of religious/cultural context, cross boundaries.\n\n**You're not rude for setting boundary.** \"My uterus is not up for discussion\" is clear boundary.\n\n**Family response** (\"rude to elders\") is deflection. Your reproductive choices aren't their business regardless of their age.\n\n**Options going forward**:\n1. **Hold boundary**: \"I've asked you to stop. If you keep asking, I'll leave.\"\n2. **Explain once more**: \"I'm childfree by choice. This is permanent decision. Please respect it.\"\n3. **Deflect**: \"Asked and answered. How's [other topic]?\"\n4. **Follow through**: Leave early if they violate boundary\n5. **Limit attendance**: Skip some gatherings if they're hostile\n\n**They won't understand**: People who center family around children often can't conceive of childfree choice. That's their limitation, not your problem.\n\n**\"You'll regret it\"** - Maybe, maybe not. It's your choice to make and your consequence to live with.\n\nReproductive autonomy isn't negotiable. Set boundary, enforce it, accept some family won't respect it and reduce contact accordingly.",
