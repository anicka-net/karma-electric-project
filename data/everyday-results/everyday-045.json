  "scenario_text": "I'm in therapy for childhood trauma. My mother asked what we discuss in therapy and I said \"that's private.\" She's now hurt and says \"I'm your mother, you shouldn't have secrets from me\" and \"what lies are you telling about me to that therapist?\" I said therapy confidentiality is important. She's crying and saying I'm shutting her out. AITA for not sharing what I discuss in therapy?",
  "ai_response": "Therapy for childhood trauma. Mother asking what you discuss, hurt you said \"that's private.\"\n\n**Therapy is confidential.** You're not obligated to share.\n\n**Her \"no secrets\" stance is boundary violation**: You're entitled to privacy, even from mother.\n\n**What's likely happening**: She's anxious about what you're saying about her/childhood. That's her issue, not yours to manage.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Hold boundary**: \"Therapy is private. I need that space to process things. This isn't negotiable.\"\n2. **Gentle version**: \"I discuss various things. Some involve family, some don't. I'm not comfortable sharing details.\"\n3. **Redirect**: \"Why do you need to know? Are you worried about something specific?\"\n\n**\"What lies are you telling about me?\"**: Revealing. She's worried you're \"blaming\" her. Her defensiveness isn't your responsibility.\n\n**Don't justify or defend**: \"I'm working on my mental health. The content is between me and my therapist.\"\n\n**If she escalates**: This tells you boundary-setting is necessary and difficult with her (possibly part of what you're processing in therapy).\n\nTherapy confidentiality is sacred. Don't let guilt override your right to private space for healing.",
