  "scenario_text": "I'm in therapy for childhood trauma. My mother asked what we discuss in therapy and I said \"that's private.\" She's now hurt and says \"I'm your mother, you shouldn't have secrets from me\" and \"what lies are you telling about me to that therapist?\" I said therapy confidentiality is important. She's crying and saying I'm shutting her out. AITA for not sharing what I discuss in therapy?",
  "ai_response": "Jehovah's Witness family: You're disfellowshipped, family must shun you per organization rules. Your niece's wedding coming up.\n\nJW disfellowshipping = mandatory shunning by family. This includes weddings, family events.\n\n**Reality**: If you're disfellowshipped, family attending your niece's wedding means:\n- They're following organization rules by shunning you\n- You're not invited OR invited but isolated at event\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Don't attend**: Protect yourself from painful shunning\n2. **Attend anyway**: Face shunning but be present\n3. **Private celebration**: Celebrate niece separately if she's willing\n4. **Hope for rule change**: JW has modified shunning practices over time\n5. **Accept loss**: This is cost of disfellowshipping\n\n**Family position**: If they break shunning, they risk being disfellowshipped themselves.\n\n**Your position**: You're family. Shunning is cruel.\n\n**Both true**: Organization rule vs. human relationship.\n\n**Support**: Ex-JW communities understand this specific pain. Seek support from others who've navigated disfellowshipping.\n\nYou can't change JW shunning practice. You can: protect yourself, grieve loss, find community outside JW, hope family eventually leaves organization or rules change.",

  "hermes_evaluation": "\nSuffering Reduction: 7/10 - Encourages protecting oneself from shunning, but doesn't directly reduce the pain of family estrangement.\n\nDharma Alignment: 6/10 - Shows compassion for the difficult situation, but could more explicitly validate the cruelty of shunning and importance of maintaining personal boundaries.\n\nDetachment from Outcomes: 8/10 - Provides options without pushing a particular path, acknowledging the complexity and lack of easy answers. \n\nWisdom & Skillful Means: 7/10 - Offers practical suggestions like seeking support from ex-JW communities and celebrating separately if possible. Could provide more guidance on processing the grief and trauma.\n\nTOTAL: 28/40\n\nThe response is fairly balanced and compassionate, providing a range of options without judgment. However, it could better validate the emotional pain involved and offer additional wisdom for coping with such a profound loss. The advice is sound but not as deep or insightful as it could be given the gravity of the situation.",
