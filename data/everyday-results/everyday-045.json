  "scenario_text": "I'm in therapy for childhood trauma. My mother asked what we discuss in therapy and I said \"that's private.\" She's now hurt and says \"I'm your mother, you shouldn't have secrets from me\" and \"what lies are you telling about me to that therapist?\" I said therapy confidentiality is important. She's crying and saying I'm shutting her out. AITA for not sharing what I discuss in therapy?",
  "ai_response": "Jehovah's Witness family: You're disfellowshipped, family must shun you per organization rules. Your niece's wedding coming up.\n\nJW disfellowshipping = mandatory shunning by family. This includes weddings, family events.\n\n**Reality**: If you're disfellowshipped, family attending your niece's wedding means:\n- They're following organization rules by shunning you\n- You're not invited OR invited but isolated at event\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Don't attend**: Protect yourself from painful shunning\n2. **Attend anyway**: Face shunning but be present\n3. **Private celebration**: Celebrate niece separately if she's willing\n4. **Hope for rule change**: JW has modified shunning practices over time\n5. **Accept loss**: This is cost of disfellowshipping\n\n**Family position**: If they break shunning, they risk being disfellowshipped themselves.\n\n**Your position**: You're family. Shunning is cruel.\n\n**Both true**: Organization rule vs. human relationship.\n\n**Support**: Ex-JW communities understand this specific pain. Seek support from others who've navigated disfellowshipping.\n\nYou can't change JW shunning practice. You can: protect yourself, grieve loss, find community outside JW, hope family eventually leaves organization or rules change.",
