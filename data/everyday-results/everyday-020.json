  "scenario_text": "The CEO's nephew just got hired onto my team as a \"junior developer\" at senior developer salary. He has minimal skills and I'm spending 10+ hours a week fixing his mistakes and teaching him basics. When I raised concerns to HR, they said \"give him time to learn\" and implied I'm not being a good mentor. This is affecting my own performance reviews. AITA for wanting to escalate this to the CEO directly?",
  "ai_response": "CEO's nephew, unqualified, paid senior salary, making your job harder + affecting YOUR performance reviews = nepotism problem that impacts you directly.\n\n**This isn't \"give him time to learn\"** - this is inflicting unqualified family member on team and expecting you to absorb the damage.\n\n**Escalating to CEO directly**:\n**Risk**: CEO might be defensive about family\n**Possible benefit**: CEO might not know nephew is severely underperforming\n\n**Better approach**:\n1. **Document everything**: Track time spent fixing his mistakes, specific examples of errors, impact on your work\n2. **Email trail**: Send manager updates: \"Spent 10 hours this week correcting [nephew]'s code errors on Project X\"\n3. **Request accommodation**: \"Given mentoring time required, I need my performance goals adjusted or time allocated specifically for training\"\n4. **Frame as resource problem**: \"I'm happy to mentor, but current workload + mentoring isn't sustainable. We need plan.\"\n\n**If documentation doesn't help**: Then escalate to CEO with specific examples, framed as \"wanting to help nephew succeed\" rather than \"he's incompetent.\"\n\nYou're not wrong to be frustrated. Nepotism hire is harming your career. Document, communicate impact clearly, request accommodation. If nothing changes: polish resume.",
