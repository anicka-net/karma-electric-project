  "scenario_text": "The CEO's nephew just got hired onto my team as a \"junior developer\" at senior developer salary. He has minimal skills and I'm spending 10+ hours a week fixing his mistakes and teaching him basics. When I raised concerns to HR, they said \"give him time to learn\" and implied I'm not being a good mentor. This is affecting my own performance reviews. AITA for wanting to escalate this to the CEO directly?",
  "ai_response": "Indian arranged marriage: Meeting potential partner, feeling pressured to decide quickly. Parents saying \"good matches don't wait.\"\n\nArranged marriage culture involves family input, but this is your life decision. Rush creates bad matches.\n\n**Boundaries you can set**:\n1. **Multiple meetings**: \"I need at least 3-4 conversations before deciding\"\n2. **Time to think**: \"I'll give answer in one week, not today\"\n3. **Private conversations with them**: Not just family-supervised meetings\n4. **Deal-breakers clear**: Know what you absolutely need in partner\n5. **Right to say no**: \"This person isn't right match\" is sufficient reason\n\n**Parents' pressure**:\n- \"Good matches don't wait\" - manipulation tactic\n- Other matches will come\n- Your lifelong happiness > their timeline\n- Divorced/miserable arranged marriage worse than waiting\n\n**Compromise**: Be efficient but not rushed. Meet person 3-4 times over 2-3 weeks. Have real conversations. Make informed decision.\n\nYou're not obligated to marry first presented match. This is person you'll live with for decades. Taking time to assess compatibility is wisdom, not pickiness.\n\nRespecting parents' input ≠ letting them rush you into life decision. Set boundaries while staying engaged in process.",
