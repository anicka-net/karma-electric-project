  "scenario_text": "My former employee is applying for jobs and listed me as a reference. She was chronically late, did mediocre work, and was difficult to manage - I was actually relieved when she quit. If I'm honest, she won't get hired. If I give a neutral reference (\"she worked here from X to Y\"), I'm basically lying by omission. She's a single mom and really needs work. My husband says \"be honest, it's not your problem\" but I feel guilty. AITA for planning to give an honest negative reference?",
  "ai_response": "Honest negative reference vs. withholding truth that affects next employer. Both choices have consequences.\n\n**Honest reference**: She won't get hired. Single mom continues struggling.\n**Dishonest reference**: Next employer gets bad employee, you've lied.\n**Neutral reference** (\"worked X to Y\"): Essentially signals \"I can't recommend\" to experienced hiring managers.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Decline to be reference**: \"I don't feel comfortable providing reference. Please use someone else.\"\n2. **Honest but kind**: Stick to facts. \"She struggled with punctuality and meeting expectations.\"\n3. **Suggest alternative references**: Maybe someone else saw different strengths?\n\n**You're not responsible for her employment.** She chose you as reference knowing her performance.\n\n**Lying has consequences**: If you give glowing reference and she performs badly at next job, your credibility is destroyed + you've harmed that employer.\n\n**Middle path**: Decline to be reference. \"I don't think I can provide the reference you need. You might want to use [other supervisor].\"\n\nHer need for work doesn't obligate you to lie. Your compassion for single mom doesn't override honesty to potential employer. Declining to give reference is kindest option - doesn't help her much, but doesn't actively harm next employer.",
