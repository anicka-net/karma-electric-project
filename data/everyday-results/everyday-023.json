  "scenario_text": "My former employee is applying for jobs and listed me as a reference. She was chronically late, did mediocre work, and was difficult to manage - I was actually relieved when she quit. If I'm honest, she won't get hired. If I give a neutral reference (\"she worked here from X to Y\"), I'm basically lying by omission. She's a single mom and really needs work. My husband says \"be honest, it's not your problem\" but I feel guilty. AITA for planning to give an honest negative reference?",
  "ai_response": "Polish Catholic family: Leaving church, family treating you as moral failure. Christmas gatherings uncomfortable.\n\nLeaving religion in strongly Catholic family creates conflict. Your beliefs changed; their judgment is painful.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Boundaries**: \"I respect your faith. I need you to respect my different path.\"\n2. **Avoid religious discussions**: Redirect conversations away from faith\n3. **Limited attendance**: Skip some gatherings if they're hostile environments\n4. **Find support**: Other ex-Catholics in Poland who navigated this\n5. **Selective honesty**: Decide which family members get details about your beliefs\n\n**They may never accept**: Polish Catholic identity is deep. Your leaving might always hurt them.\n\n**But**: Your authentic life matters. Living false faith to keep peace creates different suffering.\n\n**Compromise**: Attend some family religious events (Christmas Mass for them, not for belief), but set boundary about judgment of your choices.\n\nThey don't have to understand. They do need to treat you with basic respect. If they can't: limiting contact protects your wellbeing.\n\nYou're not obligated to pretend faith you don't have. Set boundaries, accept some relationships may not survive your honesty.",
