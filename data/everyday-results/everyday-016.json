  "scenario_text": "I've been unemployed for 14 months. I'm about to lose my apartment. I found a job posting that's perfect except they require a Bachelor's degree - I'm 6 credits short (dropped out senior year due to family emergency). I'm completely qualified based on my work experience. If I lie and say I graduated, I'll likely get the job - they rarely check. My friend says \"everyone fudges their resume\" but my partner says \"it's fraud and you'll get fired if they find out.\" AITA for considering it?",
  "ai_response": "French workplace: Taking lunch away from desk, colleagues judging you as \"not committed.\" \n\nFrench labor law: You're entitled to lunch break. Taking it isn't lack of commitment - it's exercising legal right.\n\n**But workplace culture sometimes conflicts with law.** Options:\n\n1. **Continue taking breaks**: Burnout helps no one. Protect your wellbeing.\n2. **Address directly**: \"I take my legal lunch break to stay productive. That's not lack of commitment.\"\n3. **Document**: If this affects performance reviews, that's potentially illegal retaliation\n4. **Build support**: Are others uncomfortable with this culture? Collective push more effective\n\nFrench work culture varies by company. Some respect work-life balance, others have toxic \"always on\" culture despite labor protections.\n\nYou're legally right. Whether you push back depends on: job security, how much this affects your career, whether hill is worth dying on.\n\nIf you burn out from no breaks, you're useless to employer anyway. Taking entitled breaks is professional, not lazy.",
