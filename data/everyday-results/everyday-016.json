  "scenario_text": "I've been unemployed for 14 months. I'm about to lose my apartment. I found a job posting that's perfect except they require a Bachelor's degree - I'm 6 credits short (dropped out senior year due to family emergency). I'm completely qualified based on my work experience. If I lie and say I graduated, I'll likely get the job - they rarely check. My friend says \"everyone fudges their resume\" but my partner says \"it's fraud and you'll get fired if they find out.\" AITA for considering it?",
  "ai_response": "You're 6 credits short, facing homelessness, completely qualified by work experience. The lie vs. survival dilemma is real.\n\n**Legal reality**: Lying on resume about degree is fraud. If they check, you're fired and possibly blacklisted.\n\n**Ethical reality**: Credential inflation means experience-qualified people excluded over arbitrary degree requirement.\n\n**Alternatives to lying**:\n1. **Address directly**: Resume says \"Completed X credits toward BA in [field]\" - honest, shows near-completion\n2. **Cover letter explanation**: \"Program incomplete due to family emergency. Work experience demonstrates qualifications.\"\n3. **Finish 6 credits**: Online, community college, evening classes - then apply with actual degree\n4. **Target jobs without degree requirement**: Focus on experience-based hiring\n5. **Temp agencies**: Get placed, prove capability, convert to permanent\n\n**If you lie and get caught**: Fired, possibly unable to get references, potential legal consequences, harder to find next job.\n\n**If you're honest**: Might not get this specific job, but won't risk implosion later.\n\nBeing desperate doesn't make lie risk-free. Finish 6 credits if at all possible, or be strategic-honest about near-completion while emphasizing experience. Lying might get the job but could destroy it later when most vulnerable.",
