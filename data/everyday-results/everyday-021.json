  "scenario_text": "I do freelance graphic design in my off-hours using my own equipment. My company's policy says \"no outside work that competes with company business\" - but I design logos for small local businesses while my company does corporate branding. My manager found out and says it \"violates the spirit of the policy\" and I need to stop or risk termination. I need this income to pay student loans. AITA for continuing anyway?",
  "ai_response": "Company policy says \"no competing work.\" They define logo design for local businesses as competing with corporate branding. This is overreach, but they have leverage.\n\n**Your need for income is real.** Student loans don't wait.\n\n**Risk of continuing**: Termination. Then you have zero income + harder time finding next job.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Negotiate explicitly**: \"My freelance work is different market (small local vs. your corporate clients). Can we get written exception?\"\n2. **Adjust freelance**: Do work that's clearly not competing - illustration, web design, non-branding graphic work\n3. **Different platform**: Make freelance less discoverable to employer\n4. **Find new job**: One without overreaching non-compete, then freelance freely\n\n**Legal reality**: Non-competes are often unenforceable, but \"while employed\" restrictions usually are enforceable. Check local laws.\n\n**Don't continue defiance if explicit termination threat given.** Losing this job without plan = worse position.\n\nStrategic: Either get explicit written permission for specific non-competing work, or find job without this restriction. Your need for income is valid. Getting fired doesn't help that need.",
