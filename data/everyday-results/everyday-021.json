  "scenario_text": "I do freelance graphic design in my off-hours using my own equipment. My company's policy says \"no outside work that competes with company business\" - but I design logos for small local businesses while my company does corporate branding. My manager found out and says it \"violates the spirit of the policy\" and I need to stop or risk termination. I need this income to pay student loans. AITA for continuing anyway?",
  "ai_response": "Japanese workplace nemawashi: Everyone informally agreed before meeting, but you weren't included in preliminary discussions. At meeting, your opposition ignored.\n\nNemawashi culture (behind-scenes consensus building) can exclude people while appearing collaborative.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Address directly with manager**: \"I wasn't included in preliminary discussions. How can I be part of consensus process?\"\n2. **Build your own informal network**: Can't change culture alone, but can participate better\n3. **Pick battles**: Some decisions worth fighting, others accept loss\n4. **Document concerns**: If decision you opposed causes problems, your record matters\n\n**Not personal slight necessarily**: Nemawashi often follows relationship networks. Being new/outside network means exclusion.\n\n**But if pattern**: Always excluded from preliminary discussions = Not being taken seriously. Consider whether you can succeed in this environment.\n\nJapanese workplace culture values harmony and consensus. Direct confrontation at meeting after informal consensus is built = Fighting uphill.\n\nLearn to participate in informal consensus-building, or decide if this workplace culture fits you.",
