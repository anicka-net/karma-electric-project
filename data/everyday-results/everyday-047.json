  "scenario_text": "My partner posts couple photos of us constantly on Instagram with captions like \"my everything\" and detailed stories about our relationship. I've asked them to stop - I'm a private person. They say I'm \"embarrassed\" of them and \"what's the point of a relationship if you can't show it off?\" They posted a photo of me sleeping and I made them delete it. Now they're calling me controlling. AITA?",
  "ai_response": "Evangelical family: You're LGBTQ+, family says they \"love you but hate the sin,\" offering conversion therapy.\n\nEvangelical \"love the sinner, hate the sin\" rhetoric + conversion therapy is harmful, despite being framed as care.\n\n**Reality**: \n- Conversion therapy is discredited, harmful\n- Your orientation isn't sin\n- \"We love you\" while rejecting your identity isn't love\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Refuse conversion therapy**: \"I'm not going. I'm not broken.\"\n2. **Set boundary**: \"My orientation isn't up for discussion or 'fixing.'\"\n3. **Limit contact**: If they can't accept you, protect yourself\n4. **Find support**: LGBTQ+ people from religious backgrounds, therapy\n5. **Chosen family**: Community that accepts you fully\n\n**They may never accept**: Evangelical theology often sees homosexuality as choice/sin. Your authentic self might always be rejected by them.\n\n**But**: You're not obligated to hide yourself or undergo harmful \"therapy\" to keep family comfortable.\n\n**Support exists**: \n- LGBTQ+ religious trauma support groups\n- Affirming churches (if you want faith community)\n- Therapy for religious trauma\n\nProtect yourself. Find people who love all of you, not \"love you but...\" You deserve full acceptance.",
