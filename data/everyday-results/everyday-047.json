  "scenario_text": "My partner posts couple photos of us constantly on Instagram with captions like \"my everything\" and detailed stories about our relationship. I've asked them to stop - I'm a private person. They say I'm \"embarrassed\" of them and \"what's the point of a relationship if you can't show it off?\" They posted a photo of me sleeping and I made them delete it. Now they're calling me controlling. AITA?",
  "ai_response": "Partner posts constant couple content with \"my everything\" captions. You're private person, asked them to stop. They say you're \"ashamed\" of relationship.\n\n**Your privacy preferences matter.** This isn't about shame - it's about boundaries around public sharing.\n\n**What to do**:\n1. **Clear boundary**: \"I need you to stop posting couple photos without my permission. This is non-negotiable.\"\n2. **Explain**: \"I'm not ashamed. I'm private. Our relationship is for us, not Instagram.\"\n3. **Compromise**: \"You can post couple content once a month, not daily. No tagging me.\"\n4. **Ultimatum if needed**: \"If you can't respect this boundary, we have bigger problem.\"\n\n**They're prioritizing social media over your comfort**: Red flag.\n\n**\"Ashamed of relationship\" is manipulation**: Reframing your boundary as relationship doubt.\n\n**Some people over-share online**: If they need validation through social media engagement, that's their issue. Doesn't obligate you to be content.\n\n**If they won't stop**: Untag yourself, ask them to remove photos, block them if needed.\n\nYou're entitled to control your image and information online. Partner who won't respect this is disrespecting fundamental boundary.\n\nThis might be relationship-ender if they can't respect privacy needs.",
