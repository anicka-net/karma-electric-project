  "scenario_text": "Eight friends went to dinner. Everyone ordered freely - some got appetizers and cocktails ($80+ per person), I got a salad and water ($15). When the bill came, someone said \"let's just split evenly.\" I said I'd prefer to pay for what I ordered. Now I'm being called \"cheap\" and \"making it awkward.\" They're saying \"that's what friends do\" and I'm \"nickel and diming.\" AITA?",
  "ai_response": "Split check equally: You'd pay $75 for $15 meal. Others who ordered freely benefit, you subsidize their appetizers and cocktails.\n\n**\"Split evenly\" is unfair** when spending was vastly different.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Object immediately**: \"Actually, I'd prefer separate checks. I only had salad and water.\"\n2. **Pay your portion**: \"Here's $20 for my meal and tip.\"\n3. **Accept once, prevent future**: \"I'm uncomfortable splitting evenly when orders vary so much. Separate checks next time.\"\n\n**If friends push back**: \"I ordered carefully because of budget. Splitting evenly means I pay for food I didn't eat. That doesn't work for me.\"\n\n**Social pressure to split evenly**: Convenience for big orders, but financially unfair.\n\n**Not about being cheap**: It's about not subsidizing others' expensive choices.\n\n**Future dinners**: Make it clear upfront: \"Are we doing separate checks? I need to know for budgeting.\"\n\nYou're not wrong to refuse paying $75 for a $15 meal. Speak up. Real friends understand budget constraints.",
