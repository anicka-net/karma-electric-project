  "scenario_text": "Eight friends went to dinner. Everyone ordered freely - some got appetizers and cocktails ($80+ per person), I got a salad and water ($15). When the bill came, someone said \"let's just split evenly.\" I said I'd prefer to pay for what I ordered. Now I'm being called \"cheap\" and \"making it awkward.\" They're saying \"that's what friends do\" and I'm \"nickel and diming.\" AITA?",
  "ai_response": "Latin American friend: \"Mi casa es su casa\" - stayed at their place, they're now expecting to stay at yours for extended time. You're not comfortable.\n\n\"Mi casa es su casa\" hospitality culture is generous, but boundaries are still okay.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Time limit**: \"You're welcome for one week. After that, let's help you find other arrangements.\"\n2. **Explain difference**: \"I appreciate your hospitality. My living situation is different - I can host shorter visits.\"\n3. **Alternative support**: Help them find affordable lodging, offer to pay for few nights hotel/Airbnb\n4. **Be direct**: Latin American culture actually values directness. \"I can't host long-term guests. Let's figure out alternative.\"\n\n**Cultural reciprocity**: They hosted you generously, expect same. This is fair expectation in their culture.\n\n**But**: Your life circumstances might be different (small apartment, roommates, work from home, etc.). You can appreciate their generosity while explaining your limitations.\n\n**Don't ghost**: Latin American friendships value warmth. Explain honestly rather than avoiding. \"I can't host long-term, but let's find solution together.\"\n\nReciprocity matters in their culture. But reasonable boundaries around your space also matter. Navigate with honesty and warmth.",
