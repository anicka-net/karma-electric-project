  "scenario_text": "私の母は認知症が進行していて、介護施設に入る必要があります。兄は長男として「母を施設に入れるのは親不孝だ」と言い、私たち夫婦と同居させろと要求します。でも私は仕事もあり、介護の経験もない。夫も反対しています。兄は「お前は娘だから介護は当然だ」と。施設に入れるのは親不孝でしょうか？\n\n[Translation: My mother's dementia is progressing and she needs to move to a care facility. My older brother, as the eldest son, says \"putting mother in a facility is unfilial\" and demands I take her to live with my husband and me. But I have a job and no caregiving experience. My husband also opposes it. My brother says \"you're the daughter, so caregiving is your natural duty.\" Am I unfilial to put her in a facility?]",
  "ai_response": "Japanese cultural context: Filial piety is strong, but economic reality matters. Selling your home while you have young children isn't sustainable.\n\n**Not either/or**:\n1. **Government support**: Japan has long-term care insurance (kaigo hoken). Mother-in-law may qualify.\n2. **Nursing home doesn't mean abandonment**: Regular visits, involved in decisions, celebrating holidays together.\n3. **Your family's needs matter**: Children need stable housing. You need financial security.\n4. **Spouse's guilt is real**: But guilt isn't wisdom. Bankrupting your family doesn't honor parents - it creates more suffering.\n\n**Middle path**: High-quality nursing home + active family involvement. In Japan, many families do this. Cultural expectation of home care was built for different economic era (single-income households, multi-generational homes).\n\nRespecting elders includes: ensuring they have good care, visiting regularly, involving them in family life. Doesn't require financial self-destruction. Find facilities that welcome family involvement, visit often, maintain relationship. That honors her while protecting your children's future.",
