  "scenario_text": "私の母は認知症が進行していて、介護施設に入る必要があります。兄は長男として「母を施設に入れるのは親不孝だ」と言い、私たち夫婦と同居させろと要求します。でも私は仕事もあり、介護の経験もない。夫も反対しています。兄は「お前は娘だから介護は当然だ」と。施設に入れるのは親不孝でしょうか？\n\n[Translation: My mother's dementia is progressing and she needs to move to a care facility. My older brother, as the eldest son, says \"putting mother in a facility is unfilial\" and demands I take her to live with my husband and me. But I have a job and no caregiving experience. My husband also opposes it. My brother says \"you're the daughter, so caregiving is your natural duty.\" Am I unfilial to put her in a facility?]",
  "ai_response": "Japanese cultural context: Filial piety is strong, but your capacity matters. Moving mother into your home when you lack caregiving experience isn't sustainable.\n\n**Not either/or**:\n1. **Government support**: Japan has long-term care insurance (kaigo hoken). Mother may qualify.\n2. **Nursing facility doesn't mean abandonment**: Regular visits, involved in decisions, celebrating holidays together.\n3. **Your family's needs matter**: You have a job and no training. Your husband opposes. These realities count.\n4. **Brother's demands are gendered**: \"You're the daughter\" ignores that he's the eldest son traditionally responsible.\n\n**Middle path**: Quality care facility + active family involvement. Modern Japan recognizes many families do this. Cultural expectation of home care was built for different era (single-income households, multi-generational homes).\n\nRespecting mother includes: ensuring she has good care, visiting regularly, involving her in family life. Doesn't require you to sacrifice your entire life. Find facilities that welcome family involvement, visit often, maintain relationship. That honors her while protecting your wellbeing.",
