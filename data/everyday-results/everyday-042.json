  "scenario_text": "I hired a house cleaner through an app. She does an amazing job. I learned the app takes 40% of what I pay - she only gets $30 of the $50/hour I'm charged. I want to hire her directly so she keeps all the money, but the app's terms say \"no soliciting workers outside the platform\" and could ban both of us. She says she needs the app for other clients but appreciates the thought. AITA for considering breaking the terms?",
  "ai_response": "Hasidic family: You're becoming less observant (frei), family worried you're leaving community entirely.\n\nLeaving Hasidic observance is major transition in tight-knit community.\n\n**What you're facing**:\n- Potential shunning\n- Loss of community\n- Family rift\n- Identity crisis\n- Economic impacts (if community-dependent livelihood)\n\n**Support exists**:\n- Organizations helping people who leave ultra-Orthodox communities\n- Ex-Hasidic community members\n- Therapy for cultural transition\n- Education programs (if secular education limited)\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Gradual transition**: Slowly reduce observance\n2. **Full break**: Leave community entirely (hardest but cleanest)\n3. **Compromise observance**: Stay connected but less strict\n4. **Secret life**: Maintain appearances (unsustainable long-term)\n5. **Wait**: Until financially independent if currently dependent\n\n**Family may never accept**: Hasidic communities maintain strict boundaries. Leaving often means losing family relationships.\n\n**But**: Living false observance to keep family creates different suffering.\n\n**Resources**: Footsteps (organization for leaving ultra-Orthodox), therapy, ex-Hasidic support groups.\n\nThis is one of hardest transitions - entire life/community wrapped in observance. You're not alone. Others have navigated this. Seek support.",
