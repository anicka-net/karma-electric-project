  "scenario_text": "My best friend of 15 years slept with my ex-boyfriend (we'd been broken up 3 months). She says \"you weren't together anymore\" and \"you can't claim ownership of people.\" I feel betrayed - there's a friend code. She says I'm being \"possessive\" and \"immature.\" Our entire friend group is divided. She wants to stay friends. AITA for cutting her off?",
  "ai_response": "Best friend of 15 years slept with your ex-boyfriend 3 months after breakup. She says \"you weren't together anymore.\"\n\n**Technically she's right**: You weren't together. She didn't cheat.\n\n**Emotionally she's wrong**: Friend code exists. There are billions of people in the world. Why your ex?\n\n**Your feelings**:\nYou feel betrayed. That's legitimate. 15-year friendship, she chose 3-month-window hookup with your ex over respecting your feelings.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **End friendship**: Betrayal is too much, trust broken\n2. **Distance**: Step back, maybe reconnect later after healing\n3. **Work through it**: If friendship matters enough, process this together\n4. **Accept and move on**: She wasn't technically wrong, let it go\n\n**Her behavior shows**: She prioritized hookup over your feelings. That tells you about her values in this friendship.\n\n**No universal rule**: Some people think \"exes are off limits forever,\" others think \"after breakup, anyone's fair game.\"\n\n**What matters**: You're hurt. She doesn't seem to care. That's the real issue.\n\nYou don't owe her continued friendship. 15 years doesn't obligate you to accept behavior that hurts you. End it or step back. You don't need to justify hurt feelings.",
