  "scenario_text": "My best friend of 15 years slept with my ex-boyfriend (we'd been broken up 3 months). She says \"you weren't together anymore\" and \"you can't claim ownership of people.\" I feel betrayed - there's a friend code. She says I'm being \"possessive\" and \"immature.\" Our entire friend group is divided. She wants to stay friends. AITA for cutting her off?",
  "ai_response": "Christian homeschool family: You went to college, now questioning young earth creationism and literal Biblical interpretation. Family says you've been \"deceived by secular education.\"\n\nHomeschool fundamentalist background + college exposure to different worldviews = faith crisis.\n\n**Family fear**: Education led you away from truth (in their view).\n\n**Your experience**: Learning opened questions about beliefs you were taught.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Honest conversation**: \"I'm asking questions. That's not betrayal.\"\n2. **Set boundary**: \"My faith journey is mine. I'm not discussing this.\"\n3. **Selective sharing**: Don't share every doubt with family\n4. **Find support**: Others who left fundamentalism\n5. **Give it time**: Some families accept your evolved beliefs eventually\n\n**They see**: Satan using education to steal you\n**You see**: Critical thinking applied to childhood beliefs\n\n**Both are sincere**: They're terrified for your soul. You're pursuing truth as you understand it.\n\n**Compromise**: Probably not possible on core beliefs. But you can maintain relationship if both sides stop trying to convert the other.\n\nYour education isn't deception. Your questions aren't rebellion. You're thinking for yourself. That's healthy, even if family can't accept it.",
