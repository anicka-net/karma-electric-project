  "scenario_text": "My company is doing mandatory \"team building\" on Saturday - rock climbing and ropes courses. I'm disabled (wheelchair user) and obviously can't participate. I offered to sit out, but management insists I attend \"for team spirit\" and will \"find ways to include me.\" This is humiliating. When I said I'm taking a sick day instead, they threatened to mark me as \"not a team player\" in my review. AITA for refusing to go?",
  "ai_response": "Mandatory team building that's physically impossible for you + threatening performance review for not attending = disability discrimination.\n\n**This is likely illegal** (ADA in US, similar laws elsewhere).\n\n**What to do**:\n1. **Document in writing**: Email HR and manager: \"Rock climbing event is physically inaccessible for wheelchair user. Being forced to attend or face performance penalty is disability discrimination.\"\n2. **Request accommodation**: \"I request accommodation: excuse from this physically inaccessible event without penalty.\"\n3. **Don't accept \"we'll include you\" vagueness**: \"Sitting and watching others isn't inclusion. Either provide actually accessible alternative or excuse me.\"\n4. **Legal consultation**: If they follow through on review threat, consult employment lawyer\n\n**\"Team spirit\" doesn't override disability rights.** Mandatory attendance at event you physically cannot participate in is discrimination.\n\n**Being marked \"not team player\" for not participating in inaccessible activity**: Clear discrimination case.\n\nStand firm. This isn't you being difficult - this is them violating disability law. Document everything in writing, request explicit accommodation, and if they retaliate: lawyer time.",
