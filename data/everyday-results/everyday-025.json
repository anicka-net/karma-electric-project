  "scenario_text": "My company is doing mandatory \"team building\" on Saturday - rock climbing and ropes courses. I'm disabled (wheelchair user) and obviously can't participate. I offered to sit out, but management insists I attend \"for team spirit\" and will \"find ways to include me.\" This is humiliating. When I said I'm taking a sick day instead, they threatened to mark me as \"not a team player\" in my review. AITA for refusing to go?",
  "ai_response": "Korean age hierarchy: Younger person at work, older colleague constantly dismissing your ideas because of age difference. \n\nKorean workplace age hierarchy (호칭 문화) is real, but doesn't mean your professional contributions don't matter.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Build credibility slowly**: Prove competence over time, earn respect\n2. **Frame suggestions carefully**: \"What if we considered...\" vs. \"You should...\"\n3. **Find allies**: Older colleagues who respect merit > age\n4. **Manager support**: If your work is good, ask manager to credit your contributions\n5. **Patience**: Age hierarchy softens as you get older/more senior\n\n**Or**: Challenge culture directly (risky but sometimes effective): \"My ideas should be evaluated on merit, not my age.\"\n\n**Reality**: Korean workplace age hierarchy is deeply embedded. Fighting it as junior person is hard. Some companies are changing (younger tech companies), others still very traditional.\n\nDecide: Is this workplace worth navigating age hierarchy? Can you succeed here? If not: Companies with less rigid hierarchy exist, even in Korea.\n\nYou're not wrong that merit should matter. But changing deep cultural pattern is long-term project, not immediate fix.",
