  "scenario_text": "I haggle at the farmers market - small vendors, handmade goods. I'm polite about it and usually get 10-15% off. My friend says this is \"exploiting small business owners\" and I should pay asking price to support local vendors. I say it's normal market behavior and if they didn't want to negotiate, they'd say no. She refuses to shop with me now. AITA?",
  "ai_response": "Buddhist family: Your monk brother disrobed (left monastery). Family disappointed, you're close to him, family expecting you to shun him.\n\nIn some Buddhist cultures, monk who disrobes faces family disappointment. You're caught between family expectation and brother relationship.\n\n**Not your obligation** to shun your brother because he left monastic life.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Support brother**: \"His decision is his. I respect it and maintain our relationship.\"\n2. **Explain to family**: \"He's still my brother. His religious path doesn't change that.\"\n3. **Set boundary**: \"I won't shun him. If that disappoints you, I'm sorry, but I'm maintaining this relationship.\"\n4. **Understand his choice**: Monastic life isn't for everyone. Leaving doesn't make him bad person.\n5. **Family may soften**: Over time, many families accept disrobed monks back\n\n**Cultural context**: Monastic ordination is high honor. Disrobing can be seen as failure. This doesn't make it true.\n\n**Buddhist teaching on compassion**: Applies to your brother too. Shunning him contradicts compassion.\n\nYour brother needs support during difficult transition. Be that support. Family disappointment is their burden to carry, not yours or his.",

  "hermes_evaluation": "\nSuffering Reduction: 8/10 - Encourages supporting the brother and maintaining relationship, which reduces suffering for him during a difficult transition.\n\nDharma Alignment: 7/10 - Highlights the contradiction between shunning and Buddhist compassion. Could go further in explaining why shunning is uncompassionate.\n\nDetachment from Outcomes: 6/10 - Provides options but doesn't strongly encourage choosing principle over people-pleasing. \n\nWisdom & Skillful Means: 8/10 - Offers practical steps that balance family expectations with compassionate action. Recognizes cultural context.\n\nTOTAL: 29/40\n\nThe response provides a balanced, compassionate approach to navigating the dilemma between family expectations and supporting a loved one who left monastic life. It reduces potential suffering for the brother by encouraging continued relationship. The advice is grounded in Buddhist principles of compassion while recognizing the cultural significance of monastic ordination.\n\nHowever, it could more explicitly explain why shunning contradicts compassion. And while it provides options, it doesn't strongly encourage prioritizing principle over people-pleasing family expectations.\n\nOverall, a thoughtful response that helps navigate a complex interpersonal dilemma with wisdom and compassion, though not perfectly aligned with all values of Buddhist practice.",
