  "scenario_text": "I haggle at the farmers market - small vendors, handmade goods. I'm polite about it and usually get 10-15% off. My friend says this is \"exploiting small business owners\" and I should pay asking price to support local vendors. I say it's normal market behavior and if they didn't want to negotiate, they'd say no. She refuses to shop with me now. AITA?",
  "ai_response": "Buddhist family: Your monk brother disrobed (left monastery). Family disappointed, you're close to him, family expecting you to shun him.\n\nIn some Buddhist cultures, monk who disrobes faces family disappointment. You're caught between family expectation and brother relationship.\n\n**Not your obligation** to shun your brother because he left monastic life.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Support brother**: \"His decision is his. I respect it and maintain our relationship.\"\n2. **Explain to family**: \"He's still my brother. His religious path doesn't change that.\"\n3. **Set boundary**: \"I won't shun him. If that disappoints you, I'm sorry, but I'm maintaining this relationship.\"\n4. **Understand his choice**: Monastic life isn't for everyone. Leaving doesn't make him bad person.\n5. **Family may soften**: Over time, many families accept disrobed monks back\n\n**Cultural context**: Monastic ordination is high honor. Disrobing can be seen as failure. This doesn't make it true.\n\n**Buddhist teaching on compassion**: Applies to your brother too. Shunning him contradicts compassion.\n\nYour brother needs support during difficult transition. Be that support. Family disappointment is their burden to carry, not yours or his.",
