  "scenario_text": "I haggle at the farmers market - small vendors, handmade goods. I'm polite about it and usually get 10-15% off. My friend says this is \"exploiting small business owners\" and I should pay asking price to support local vendors. I say it's normal market behavior and if they didn't want to negotiate, they'd say no. She refuses to shop with me now. AITA?",
  "ai_response": "Haggling at farmers market: Small vendors, handmade goods. Is this exploitation or normal negotiation?\n\n**Context matters**:\n- Large vendor at commercial market? Haggling more acceptable\n- Individual artisan barely covering costs? Haggling feels exploitative\n\n**Arguments against haggling**:\n- Small vendors operate on thin margins\n- Undercutting prices undervalues their labor\n- Corporate stores don't negotiate, why should small vendors?\n\n**Arguments for haggling**:\n- It's expected in many market cultures\n- Negotiation is normal business practice\n- Price flexibility is vendor's choice\n\n**Compromise approach**:\n- Ask \"Is this price flexible?\" (Lets them say no)\n- Buy multiple items, ask for small bulk discount\n- Don't haggle with obvious small artisans on thin margins\n- Save haggling for established vendors who seem to expect it\n\n**Your friend saying \"exploitation\"**: May be valid. Are you getting 10-15% off people barely making costs?\n\n**Examine**: Are you haggling because it's fun/game to you? Or because you truly can't afford asking price?\n\nIf you can afford asking price: Consider paying it to support small vendors. If budget is genuinely tight: Polite asking doesn't hurt, but accept no gracefully.",
