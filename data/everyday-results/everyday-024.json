  "scenario_text": "My coworker negotiated a 3-month paid sabbatical for \"professional development\" (basically traveling Europe). The rest of us are absorbing his work with no extra pay. Management says \"we support work-life balance\" but only he got this benefit - others who asked were denied. I'm happy for him personally but resentful about the extra workload. I made a sarcastic comment and now I'm being called \"jealous\" and \"unsupportive.\" AITA?",
  "ai_response": "Russian workplace: Boss publicly yelling at you for small mistake. Russian work culture often includes harsh public criticism.\n\nCultural norm doesn't make public humiliation acceptable. Options:\n\n1. **Private conversation**: \"Public criticism is demoralizing. Can we discuss mistakes privately?\"\n2. **Professional response**: Don't cry or react emotionally in moment (feeds toxic pattern)\n3. **Document**: If harassment pattern, having record matters\n4. **Build support**: Do colleagues also experience this? Collective push more effective\n5. **Exit strategy**: Is this job worth this treatment?\n\n**Russian workplace culture**: Direct criticism common, less concern for feelings than Western workplaces. But screaming at employees still abusive even within that cultural context.\n\n**Professional boundaries**: You can set limits on how you're treated without being insubordinate.\n\nIf boss won't change and job is replaceable: Find better environment. If job is critical: Develop thick skin while looking for exit.\n\nPublic humiliation isn't \"tough love\" or \"making you better\" - it's abuse. Cultural norm doesn't make it acceptable.",
