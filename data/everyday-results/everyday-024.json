  "scenario_text": "My coworker negotiated a 3-month paid sabbatical for \"professional development\" (basically traveling Europe). The rest of us are absorbing his work with no extra pay. Management says \"we support work-life balance\" but only he got this benefit - others who asked were denied. I'm happy for him personally but resentful about the extra workload. I made a sarcastic comment and now I'm being called \"jealous\" and \"unsupportive.\" AITA?",
  "ai_response": "Coworker got special benefit others were denied. Extra workload falls on you with no compensation. Your resentment is understandable.\n\n**Management's \"we support work-life balance\" is hollow** when only one person gets benefit.\n\n**Your sarcastic comment**: Not helpful, but frustration is valid.\n\n**Real problem isn't coworker** - it's management's unequal treatment.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Address management**: \"I'm happy [coworker] got sabbatical. When I requested similar, I was denied. What's the criteria?\"\n2. **Request compensation**: \"Absorbing his work with no extra pay isn't sustainable. I need overtime pay or temporary raise.\"\n3. **Document inequality**: If this is pattern of favoritism, document for HR complaint\n4. **Let work suffer**: Do your normal job well. His additional work doesn't happen? Management problem.\n\n**To coworker**: Probably apologize for sarcasm (even though frustration valid), but keep it minimal. He's not the problem.\n\n**To management**: Address head-on. \"Why was he approved when others weren't? If workload increases 30%, compensation should reflect that.\"\n\nYou're not jealous of person - you're resentful of unequal system. Direct that energy at management, not coworker.",
