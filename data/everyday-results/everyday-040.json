  "scenario_text": "I'm invited to a destination wedding - flight and hotel will cost me $1,800. The couple has a registry with expensive items ($200-500 each). My partner says destination wedding = presence is the gift, no additional gift needed. The bride's sister posted on social media that \"guests should still give generous gifts, travel costs aren't an excuse.\" AITA for giving a $50 gift card when I've spent $1,800 to attend?",
  "ai_response": "Destination wedding: Your attendance costs $1,800. Registry has $200-500 gifts. Should presence = gift?\n\n**Arguments for \"presence is the gift\"**:\n- Destination weddings impose major cost on guests\n- $1,800 is substantial financial commitment\n- Couple chose expensive destination\n\n**Arguments for still giving gift**:\n- Gift is separate tradition from attendance\n- They didn't force you to come\n- Other guests might give gifts, you'll look cheap\n\n**Compromise options**:\n1. **Smaller gift**: $50-100 instead of $200-500\n2. **Group gift**: Pool money with other guests\n3. **Practical gift**: Something meaningful but inexpensive\n4. **Presence only**: Frame as \"We're so happy to celebrate with you! Our presence is our gift.\"\n\n**What's reasonable**:\n$1,800 travel IS substantial. Expecting full registry gift on top is a lot.\n\n**Etiquette varies**: Some cultures expect gift regardless, others understand destination = major cost.\n\n**Choose based on**: Your relationship with couple, your budget, what you can afford comfortably.\n\nSmaller gift ($50-100) + presence seems reasonable compromise. Full registry price on top of $1,800 travel is genuinely excessive unless you're very close and can easily afford it.",
