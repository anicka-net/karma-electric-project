  "scenario_text": "I'm invited to a destination wedding - flight and hotel will cost me $1,800. The couple has a registry with expensive items ($200-500 each). My partner says destination wedding = presence is the gift, no additional gift needed. The bride's sister posted on social media that \"guests should still give generous gifts, travel costs aren't an excuse.\" AITA for giving a $50 gift card when I've spent $1,800 to attend?",
  "ai_response": "Deaf culture: Cochlear implant for your deaf child. Deaf community says you're erasing deaf identity, doctors recommend implant.\n\nCochlear implant debate is deeply contentious in Deaf community.\n\n**Deaf community perspective**:\n- Deafness isn't disability to fix\n- Deaf culture is rich, valuable\n- Cochlear implants are \"fix\" mentality that rejects deaf identity\n- Child should choose when old enough\n\n**Medical perspective**:\n- Earlier implantation = better language development\n- Opens more opportunities\n- Doesn't erase deaf identity (can still participate in Deaf culture)\n\n**Your decision**: This is your child, your family. Consider:\n1. **Language access**: Will child have access to both sign and spoken language?\n2. **Deaf community connection**: Can child participate in Deaf culture regardless of implant?\n3. **Choice**: Can child decide later to not use implant? (Yes)\n4. **Support**: What resources exist for Deaf children with/without implants?\n\n**No perfect answer**: \n- Implant: Increases hearing/spoken language, but Deaf community might see as betrayal\n- No implant: Respects deaf identity, but might limit some opportunities\n\n**Middle path**: Implant + strong Deaf community connection + sign language. Child gets options.\n\nYou're not wrong either way. This is complex decision with no right answer. Make choice based on your values and child's best interest as you understand it.",
