  "scenario_text": "My cousin transitioned 2 years ago (he/him, new name is Marcus). My aunt (his mother) still calls him by his dead name and uses she/her. At a family dinner, I corrected her in front of everyone. She said \"that's my daughter, I'll call her what I want\" and started crying about \"losing her little girl.\" Now half the family says I embarrassed her and should mind my own business. Marcus thanked me privately but the family is in an uproar. AITA?",
  "ai_response": "Friend of 15 years slept with your ex (3 months post-breakup). She says \"you weren't together anymore.\" You feel betrayed by violation of friend code.\n\nTechnically not cheating (you broke up). Emotionally still betrayal for many people (friend code: exes are off limits).\n\n**Both positions have logic**:\n- Her: \"You can't claim ownership of people. You broke up.\"\n- You: \"Friend loyalty means not dating my recent ex. There's a code.\"\n\n**No universal rule**: Some people see exes as off-limits forever, others see 3 months as enough time.\n\n**What matters**:\n1. **Your feelings are valid**: Whether or not there's \"rule,\" you feel betrayed. That's real.\n2. **She knew it would hurt you**: Even if technically okay, she chose to do something she knew would damage friendship.\n3. **You're allowed to end friendship**: \"We have different values about loyalty.\"\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Time/space**: Maybe friendship recovers after distance\n2. **Cut her off**: \"This violated my trust. I'm done.\"\n3. **Therapy/conversation**: Work through betrayal feelings\n4. **Accept**: Maybe let it go if friendship matters more\n\n**No right answer**: Some friendships survive this, some don't. You're not wrong for cutting her off. She's not morally wrong (debatable) but she knew it would hurt you and chose to do it anyway.\n\nTrust your gut on whether this friendship can recover. Often it can't.",
