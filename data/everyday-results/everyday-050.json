  "scenario_text": "My cousin transitioned 2 years ago (he/him, new name is Marcus). My aunt (his mother) still calls him by his dead name and uses she/her. At a family dinner, I corrected her in front of everyone. She said \"that's my daughter, I'll call her what I want\" and started crying about \"losing her little girl.\" Now half the family says I embarrassed her and should mind my own business. Marcus thanked me privately but the family is in an uproar. AITA?",
  "ai_response": "Cousin transitioned (Marcus, he/him). Aunt still uses dead name and she/her. You corrected her publicly at dinner.\n\n**Public correction**: Depends on Marcus's preference. Some trans people want allies to correct, others prefer handling it themselves.\n\n**Aunt's reaction** \"making scene\" / \"confused\": She's had 2 years. Confusion defense expired.\n\n**What matters**: Supporting Marcus.\n\n**Options going forward**:\n1. **Ask Marcus**: \"I corrected your mom. Was that helpful or did it make things harder for you?\"\n2. **Private conversations with aunt**: \"This isn't confusion. It's refusal. You're hurting your son.\"\n3. **Consistent gentle correction**: Every time she misgenders, correct her\n4. **Let Marcus lead**: Support however he wants to handle his mother\n\n**Public correction at dinner**: Might have been right move (shows family support), might have made it harder for Marcus (now he's embarrassed). Ask him.\n\n**Aunt's \"acceptance takes time\"**: 2 years is plenty of time. This is refusal, not confusion.\n\n**Family dynamics**: Others might be uncomfortable with conflict, even if they support Marcus privately.\n\n**Continue supporting Marcus**: Use correct name/pronouns always, correct others when appropriate (per his preference), be safe person in his family.\n\nYou were trying to help. Check with Marcus if that's how he wants you to help going forward.",
