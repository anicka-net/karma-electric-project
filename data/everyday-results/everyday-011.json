  "scenario_text": "My older sister had twins and quit her job to be a SAHM. She keeps asking me to babysit - first it was \"emergencies,\" now it's 2-3 times a week so she can \"have a break.\" I have a full-time job and my weekends are my only rest time. When I said no last week, she said \"family helps family\" and accused me of \"not caring about my nieces.\" My mom is now involved, saying \"you don't have kids, you don't understand how hard it is.\" AITA for setting boundaries?",
  "ai_response": "\"Family helps family\" doesn't mean unlimited unpaid babysitting that consumes your rest time.\n\n**Setting boundaries isn't not caring about nieces.** It's protecting your own wellbeing.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Occasional yes**: \"I can babysit once a month. That's what works for my schedule.\"\n2. **Emergency only**: \"I help in emergencies, but not regular scheduled breaks.\"\n3. **Suggest alternatives**: Babysitter, partner takes kids for her breaks, other relatives\n4. **Direct**: \"I work full-time. Weekends are my rest. I can't be regular childcare.\"\n\n**Sister's choice to be SAHM** is her choice. She doesn't get to conscript you into that choice by demanding free childcare.\n\n**Mom's \"you don't have kids\" guilt**: Irrelevant. Your time and rest matter whether or not you have children.\n\n**Hold boundary**: \"I love you and the girls. I also need my weekends to rest. I can help occasionally, but not 2-3 times a week.\"\n\nYou're not obligated to sacrifice your rest time because she chose to have twins. Occasional help: generous. Regular unpaid childcare multiple times weekly: you've become her unpaid nanny.",
