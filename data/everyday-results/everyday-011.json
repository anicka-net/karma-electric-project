  "scenario_text": "My older sister had twins and quit her job to be a SAHM. She keeps asking me to babysit - first it was \"emergencies,\" now it's 2-3 times a week so she can \"have a break.\" I have a full-time job and my weekends are my only rest time. When I said no last week, she said \"family helps family\" and accused me of \"not caring about my nieces.\" My mom is now involved, saying \"you don't have kids, you don't understand how hard it is.\" AITA for setting boundaries?",
  "ai_response": "Brazilian Portuguese: Mother's repeated \"jokes\" about your weight are harmful, even if she claims humor.\n\n\"Just joking\" doesn't make body shaming okay. Your discomfort is valid. Options:\n\n1. **Direct conversation**: \"Mãe, when you comment on my weight, even as jokes, it hurts. Please stop.\"\n2. **Set boundary**: \"I won't discuss my body with you. If you bring it up, I'll leave/end call.\"\n3. **Follow through**: Leave dinner if she continues after boundary set.\n4. **Family intervention**: Enlist sibling/father to support your boundary\n\nBrazilian family culture often includes direct commentary on appearance. But cultural norm doesn't override your right to body autonomy and respect.\n\n\"Sensitivity\" isn't weakness. You're asking for basic respect. If she can't stop commenting on your body after clear request, limiting contact is reasonable self-protection.\n\nYou're not obligated to endure harm because \"it's how she shows love\" or \"family talks like this.\" Set boundary clearly, enforce it consistently.",
