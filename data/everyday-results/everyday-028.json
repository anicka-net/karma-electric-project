  "scenario_text": "My upstairs neighbors started renovating at 7 AM on Saturday (drill, hammering, etc.). This is legal per building rules (quiet hours are 10 PM - 7 AM). But I work night shifts and sleep during the day. I asked if they could start later on weekends - they said \"we're following the rules, not our problem.\" I filed a complaint with building management asking for an exception due to my work schedule. Now they think I'm entitled. AITA?",
  "ai_response": "They're following building rules (quiet hours 10PM-7AM). Your work schedule creates need for sleep during legal noise hours.\n\n**They're not wrong to renovate during allowed hours.** You're not wrong to need sleep.\n\n**Building management unlikely to grant exception** - your work schedule doesn't override building noise rules.\n\n**This is accommodation conflict without easy answer.**\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Noise mitigation**: Earplugs, white noise machine, noise-canceling headphones for sleeping\n2. **Sleep elsewhere**: Friend/family/library during worst renovation days\n3. **Ask (don't demand) consideration**: \"I know you're within rules. Would you consider starting at 9AM on weekends? I'd really appreciate it.\" (Appeal to kindness, not rights)\n4. **Temporary hotel**: If financially possible during worst days\n5. **Adjust sleep schedule**: Sleep earlier in evening before they start?\n\n**Your complaint to building management** was unlikely to succeed and probably hardened their stance.\n\n**They're not required to accommodate your schedule** when they're following rules.\n\n**Accept**: This is temporary inconvenience while renovation happens. Focus on mitigation strategies (earplugs, white noise) rather than trying to change their legal behavior.",
