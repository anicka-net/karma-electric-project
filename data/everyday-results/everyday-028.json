  "scenario_text": "My upstairs neighbors started renovating at 7 AM on Saturday (drill, hammering, etc.). This is legal per building rules (quiet hours are 10 PM - 7 AM). But I work night shifts and sleep during the day. I asked if they could start later on weekends - they said \"we're following the rules, not our problem.\" I filed a complaint with building management asking for an exception due to my work schedule. Now they think I'm entitled. AITA?",
  "ai_response": "Spanish workplace: \"Mañana\" culture - deadlines seem flexible, your German precision clashing with laid-back timing.\n\nCultural timing expectations differ. Spanish workplace often more flexible than German punctuality culture.\n\n**Navigate difference**:\n1. **Build buffer**: If deadline is \"Friday,\" assume \"sometime next week\"\n2. **Communicate clearly**: \"I need this by Wednesday end-of-day to proceed\" (Be specific)\n3. **Understand urgency levels**: Not every deadline is equally flexible - learn which ones are real\n4. **Relationship over rules**: Spanish culture values relationship building. Rigid deadline pushing might harm relationships\n5. **Choose battles**: Some deadlines critical, others can slide\n\n**You're not wrong** to value punctuality. **They're not wrong** to have more flexible work culture.\n\n**Adjustment**: Either adapt to Spanish timing, or find this mismatch is too stressful and seek work in culture matching your style.\n\nCultural difference isn't moral failing on either side. It's difference. Successful navigation requires: understanding their norms, communicating your needs clearly, finding middle ground where possible.",
