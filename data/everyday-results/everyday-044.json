  "scenario_text": "I'm pregnant and not finding out the baby's gender. My sister is throwing me a baby shower and she keeps pressuring me to do a gender reveal party - she already bought decorations and planned games around it. I've said no three times. She says I'm \"ruining her plans\" and gender reveals are \"tradition now.\" I said if she does a gender reveal, I'm not coming to my own shower. AITA?",
  "ai_response": "Pregnant, not finding out gender. Sister throwing shower, pressuring gender reveal. Bought decorations without your consent.\n\n**Your pregnancy, your choice.** She doesn't get to hijack your shower for event you don't want.\n\n**What to do**:\n1. **Clear boundary**: \"I appreciate you hosting shower. There will be no gender reveal. If you can't respect that, I'll host my own shower.\"\n2. **Talk to her now**: \"Return the decorations. We're not doing gender reveal. This isn't your decision.\"\n3. **Enlist support**: Get partner/mother/friends to back you up\n\n**She's making your pregnancy about her event**. That's wrong.\n\n**If she refuses**: Take over planning, or accept shower without gender reveal elements and shut down any attempts at reveal during event.\n\n**To guests** (if needed): \"We know [sister] has planned games around gender. We're not finding out, so ignore those activities.\"\n\n**She'll be upset**: Let her. This is your pregnancy, your choice about information sharing.\n\nDon't let her pressure override your clearly stated boundary. Your baby, your information to share or not share as you choose.",
