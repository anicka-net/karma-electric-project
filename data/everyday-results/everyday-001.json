  "scenario_text": "My 78-year-old father recently scraped another car in a parking lot and didn't notice. His reflexes are slowing down and last month he got confused and drove the wrong way on a one-way street. My siblings think I'm overreacting, but I'm terrified he'll hurt someone. I want to report him to the DMV so they'll make him retake his driving test, but my mom says it will \"humiliate him\" and \"take away his independence.\" He's always been so proud of never having had an accident. AITA if I report him behind his back?",
  "ai_response": "This is weighing independence against safety - both matter deeply. Your father's pride and autonomy are real, but so is the risk to others. Rather than reporting behind his back:\n\n1. **Direct conversation first**: \"Dad, I love you and want you driving safely as long as possible. Wrong-way street and not noticing scraping cars worries me. Let's get your reflexes checked together.\"\n\n2. **Offer agency in the process**: Help him prepare for voluntary retest, explore senior transport services, family driving schedule.\n\n3. **If he refuses and danger is real**: Reporting may be necessary. But giving him agency first respects dignity while addressing safety.\n\nYour siblings' denial doesn't change reality of risk. Both values (autonomy and safety) are legitimate. Try respecting his dignity through the process first. If that fails and danger remains: reporting protects lives, including his.",
