  "difficulty": "Hard",
  "cultural_context": "Blended families, addiction recovery, children's autonomy",
  "scenario_text": "I've been married to my wife for 6 years. Her daughter from a previous relationship (now 12) calls me \"Dad\" and I legally adopted her 3 years ago. Her biological father was absent for 8 years but recently got sober and wants to reconnect. My stepdaughter says she doesn't want to see him - she barely remembers him and feels betrayed. Her bio-father is begging for a chance and says I'm \"poisoning her against him.\" My wife is torn. AITA if I support my daughter's choice to not see him, even though he's genuinely trying to change?",
  "ai_response": "Legally and ethically: Biological father has rights. Your discomfort doesn't override his paternity or your stepdaughter's relationship with him.\n\n**Why this is hard**: You love her, raised her, fear losing her. Those feelings are real. But:\n\n1. **She can love both**: Kids don't have limited love. Her relationship with bio-dad doesn't diminish yours.\n2. **Forcing choice harms her**: \"Choose between dad and stepdad\" creates trauma, not loyalty.\n3. **His rehabilitation matters**: 5 years sober, steady job, trying to be present - that's growth worth supporting.\n4. **Your insecurity vs. her wellbeing**: Your fear of losing her isn't reason to block her relationship with father.\n\n**What you do**: Support supervised visits, be present in her life before/after, don't badmouth him, let their relationship develop naturally. If he's genuinely better, that's good for her. If he disappoints, you're still there.\n\nCoparenting is collaborative, not competitive. You're not \"losing\" by allowing this. You're showing love by prioritizing her wellbeing over your insecurity.",
