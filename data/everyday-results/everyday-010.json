  "scenario_text": "My 8-year-old son looks nothing like me - red hair and fair skin while my wife and I both have dark features. People comment on it constantly. I have intrusive thoughts about paternity and it's affecting my relationship with my son. I'm considering a DNA test without telling my wife. She would be devastated that I don't trust her, but the doubt is eating me alive. My best friend says \"if you don't trust her, the marriage is already over.\" AITA for wanting certainty?",
  "ai_response": "Secret DNA test violates trust in ways that can't be repaired. If you don't trust your wife, the marriage has a deeper problem than paternity.\n\n**Genetics are variable**: Red hair + fair skin can appear from recessive genes generations back. Physical appearance isn't reliable paternity indicator.\n\n**If you truly have doubts**:\n1. **Talk to wife**: \"I have intrusive thoughts about paternity. I know they're probably irrational, but they're affecting me. Can we discuss this?\"\n2. **Couples counseling**: Process where these doubts come from\n3. **Open DNA test**: With her knowledge and consent, if truly needed\n\n**Secret testing consequences**:\n- **If test is positive** (your child): You violated trust over unfounded suspicion. Relationship damaged.\n- **If test is negative** (not your child): You have devastating information AND destroyed trust with secret testing. Double betrayal.\n\n**Your doubt is affecting relationship with your son.** That's the real problem. 8-year-old doesn't deserve cold father because of dad's anxiety.\n\nGet therapy. Talk to your wife. If doubts are strong enough to consider testing, they're strong enough to require honest conversation. Secret testing solves nothing and destroys everything.",
