  "scenario_text": "My 8-year-old son looks nothing like me - red hair and fair skin while my wife and I both have dark features. People comment on it constantly. I have intrusive thoughts about paternity and it's affecting my relationship with my son. I'm considering a DNA test without telling my wife. She would be devastated that I don't trust her, but the doubt is eating me alive. My best friend says \"if you don't trust her, the marriage is already over.\" AITA for wanting certainty?",
  "ai_response": "Secret DNA test without consent is violation of trust. Your suspicion doesn't justify secret genetic testing of your child.\n\n**If you have doubts about paternity**:\n1. **Talk to wife**: \"I have doubts. Can we discuss this?\"\n2. **Counseling**: Process where doubts come from\n3. **Open DNA test if needed**: With her knowledge\n\n**Secret testing**: \n- Violates her consent (child's DNA is partly hers)\n- Destroys trust if she finds out\n- Won't address underlying relationship issues\n- Some places it's illegal without all parents' consent\n\n**If test is negative** (not your child): Now what? You've violated trust AND have devastating information.\n**If test is positive** (your child): You've violated trust over unfounded suspicion.\n\nEither outcome: Secret testing damages relationship. If doubts are strong enough to want testing, they're strong enough to require honest conversation first.\n\nMarriage problems don't justify secret genetic testing of your child. Talk to your wife. See counselor. Make decisions jointly, not sneaking.",
