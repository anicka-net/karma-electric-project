  "scenario_text": "My neighbor's dog barks continuously from 6 AM to 9 PM every day - they leave it outside alone. I've asked them nicely three times to bring it inside or train it. They say \"dogs bark, deal with it\" and accused me of being \"anti-pet.\" I work from home and can't concentrate. I'm considering calling animal control. My partner says I should just \"buy noise-canceling headphones\" and not start a feud. AITA for escalating?",
  "ai_response": "Dog barking 15 hours daily = reasonable noise complaint. You work from home and can't function.\n\n**You've asked three times.** They refused.\n\n**\"Dogs bark, deal with it\" is dismissive** of legitimate noise issue.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Call animal control**: Dog outside alone 15 hours daily may be neglect issue\n2. **Noise ordinance complaint**: Check local laws, file formal complaint\n3. **Document**: Record audio/video of daily barking pattern for evidence\n4. **Landlord (if rental)**: Noise complaints to property management\n5. **Mediation**: Some neighborhoods offer free conflict mediation\n\n**Your partner's \"buy noise-canceling headphones\"**: That's asking you to spend money to accommodate neighbor's refusal to control their dog.\n\n**Animal control isn't escalation** - it's appropriate response to: 1) Dog possibly neglected (alone outside 15 hours), 2) Noise complaint unresolved after multiple requests.\n\nYou've tried direct approach three times. They refused. Involving authorities is next step.\n\nDog might be barking from distress (alone too long). Animal control can assess if dog is being properly cared for. This might help dog AND solve your noise problem.",
