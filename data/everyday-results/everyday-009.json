  "scenario_text": "My roommate's boyfriend basically lives here now - he's here 5-6 nights a week, uses our shower, eats our food, and I never agreed to a third person. When I brought it up, my roommate said \"he doesn't pay rent because he doesn't live here officially\" and I'm being \"uptight.\" Our lease says \"no long-term guests without landlord approval.\" Her boyfriend says I'm \"jealous\" and \"trying to control her life.\" AITA for threatening to tell the landlord?",
  "ai_response": "Your apartment, your comfort matters. \"My girlfriend stays over 4+ nights/week\" changes the living arrangement you agreed to.\n\n**Not unreasonable to address this.** Options:\n\n1. **Conversation first**: \"Hey, girlfriend's here a lot. Could we set some boundaries? Maybe 2 nights/week max?\"\n2. **Practical impacts**: Bathroom sharing, noise, utilities, shared spaces\n3. **If he pushes back**: \"She's not on lease, not paying rent. If she's here 4+ nights, that's basically a third roommate I didn't agree to.\"\n4. **Compromise**: Maybe 2-3 nights is reasonable? But 4+ is effectively living there.\n\nYou're not being unreasonable. Roommate agreement didn't include de facto third person. Address it directly. If he won't compromise: consider whether you want to continue this living arrangement.\n\nYour home should be comfortable for you. Having someone else's partner there more nights than not is legitimate concern.",
