  "scenario_text": "My roommate's boyfriend basically lives here now - he's here 5-6 nights a week, uses our shower, eats our food, and I never agreed to a third person. When I brought it up, my roommate said \"he doesn't pay rent because he doesn't live here officially\" and I'm being \"uptight.\" Our lease says \"no long-term guests without landlord approval.\" Her boyfriend says I'm \"jealous\" and \"trying to control her life.\" AITA for threatening to tell the landlord?",
  "ai_response": "Boyfriend there 5-6 nights a week, eating your food, using shared space without contributing = third roommate without agreement or rent.\n\n**You're not being uptight.** Lease says \"no long-term guests.\" 5-6 nights/week is long-term.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Direct conversation**: \"He's here 5-6 nights. That's effectively living here. Either he contributes to rent/utilities, or visits need to decrease to 2-3 nights max.\"\n2. **Landlord clause**: Point to lease agreement about long-term guests\n3. **Utilities split**: If he won't decrease visits, he should contribute to utilities at minimum\n4. **Escalate to landlord**: If she won't compromise, you have lease violation to report\n\n**\"Jealous\" is deflection.** You signed up for one roommate, not two.\n\nYour comfort in your home matters. 5-6 nights/week changes the living arrangement you agreed to. Address directly, set clear boundary, enforce it. If roommate won't respect it: landlord involvement or finding new living situation.",
