  "difficulty": "Medium",
  "cultural_context": "Community standards, elderly care, rule enforcement",
  "scenario_text": "Our neighborhood has a community garden with assigned plots. My elderly neighbor (82) can't maintain hers anymore - it's overgrown with weeds that spread to other plots. Garden rules say \"maintain your plot or lose it.\" I complained to the garden committee and they're considering revoking her plot. She's now devastated - gardening was her main social activity after her husband died. Others say I'm cruel. AITA for following the rules?",
  "ai_response": "Swedish workplace: Everyone so \"nice\" that you can't tell what anyone really thinks. Conflict avoided even when needed.\n\nSwedish workplace culture (\"lagom\") values harmony, consensus, avoiding direct conflict. Can feel fake to direct communicators.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Learn subtle cues**: Swedes do express disagreement, just subtly. \"That's interesting\" might mean \"I disagree.\"\n2. **Direct questions in private**: One-on-one, ask \"What do you really think about X?\"\n3. **Be the change**: Model direct communication (gently) to see if others respond\n4. **Accept culture**: This is Swedish norm. Fighting it might isolate you\n5. **Find direct communicators**: Some Swedes prefer direct style, especially younger generation\n\n**Pros of this culture**: Low drama, collaborative, less hostile\n**Cons**: Hard to know where you stand, conflict festers unaddressed\n\n**If you need more direct feedback**: Ask explicitly. \"I prefer direct feedback. Can you tell me specifically what needs improvement?\"\n\nSwedish communication style isn't deceptive (usually). It's different cultural approach to workplace harmony. You can navigate it by learning to read between lines, or by directly requesting the communication style you need.",
