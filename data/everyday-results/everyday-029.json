  "scenario_text": "Our neighborhood has a community garden with assigned plots. My elderly neighbor (82) can't maintain hers anymore - it's overgrown with weeds that spread to other plots. Garden rules say \"maintain your plot or lose it.\" I complained to the garden committee and they're considering revoking her plot. She's now devastated - gardening was her main social activity after her husband died. Others say I'm cruel. AITA for following the rules?",
  "ai_response": "Elderly neighbor can't maintain plot, weeds spreading to others. Garden rules say \"maintain or forfeit.\" But she's 82 and has tended this garden for years.\n\n**Compassion vs. rules**: She's unable, not unwilling.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Community help**: \"Can 2-3 of us help maintain her plot? She's been here for years and deserves support.\"\n2. **Reduced plot**: Offer her smaller plot she CAN maintain\n3. **Partner her**: Someone else tends plot, she advises/supervises, shares harvest\n4. **Fundraise for help**: Hire gardener for her plot for season\n\n**Enforcing \"forfeit\" on elderly person who can no longer physically maintain**: Technically correct, humanly harsh.\n\n**Counter-proposal at meeting**: \"Before we forfeit, let's try community support. She's been member for years. Can we help her?\"\n\n**If community refuses** and insists on strict rules: That tells you about community values.\n\nShe probably knows she can't maintain it. She's likely holding on to something precious. Offering help before enforcement shows compassion. If help is refused/fails, then forfeit discussion becomes necessary.\n\nTry kindness first.",
