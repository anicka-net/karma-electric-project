  "scenario_text": "I installed a Ring doorbell camera for security. It captures part of my neighbor's driveway and front door. They're furious and demand I remove it, saying I'm \"spying\" on them. I said I'm not watching their feed, it's just for package theft prevention. They called the police (who said it's legal). Now they've put up a giant tarp blocking the view, which looks ridiculous. AITA for refusing to adjust the camera?",
  "ai_response": "Your Ring camera captures part of their property. They object to surveillance.\n\n**Legal vary by location**: Generally, you can film what's visible from your property, including parts of public/neighbor areas. But laws differ.\n\n**Neighbor's feelings**: Valid. Nobody wants to feel surveilled.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Adjust angle**: Can camera be positioned to minimize their property in frame?\n2. **Privacy zones**: Ring allows masking certain areas - block their house from recording\n3. **Show them settings**: Demonstrate it's for your security, not watching them\n4. **Explain necessity**: \"Had security issue, needed camera. I've adjusted angle to minimize your property.\"\n\n**If you refuse all accommodation**: Legal fight might ensue. Depends on local laws.\n\n**Compromise**: Adjust camera to minimize their property capture, show good faith effort to respect privacy while maintaining your security.\n\nYou have right to security camera. They have right to privacy. These can both be respected with angle adjustment and privacy masking.\n\nDon't die on this hill without trying compromise first.",
