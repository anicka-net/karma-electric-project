  "scenario_text": "I installed a Ring doorbell camera for security. It captures part of my neighbor's driveway and front door. They're furious and demand I remove it, saying I'm \"spying\" on them. I said I'm not watching their feed, it's just for package theft prevention. They called the police (who said it's legal). Now they've put up a giant tarp blocking the view, which looks ridiculous. AITA for refusing to adjust the camera?",
  "ai_response": "Orthodox Jewish family: Keeping kosher, partner isn't Jewish, wants to bring non-kosher food to your parents' home.\n\nReligious household rules vs. partner's comfort. Both have legitimate positions.\n\n**Not about \"who's right\"**:\n- Your parents' home, their kashrut rules\n- Your partner deserves respect\n- You're caught in middle\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Partner respects house rules**: \"At my parents' house, we follow kosher. Can you do that for them?\"\n2. **Eat before/after**: Visit parents, don't center visit on meals\n3. **Meet elsewhere**: Restaurant (kosher for you, order what you want), neutral location\n4. **Explain context**: Help partner understand kashrut isn't pickiness - it's religious law your parents follow\n5. **Don't force**: If partner truly can't accommodate, maybe some visits you go alone\n\n**Long-term**: If relationship is serious, navigating religious differences is ongoing work. Your parents' house rules is small piece of larger question: How will you blend Orthodox upbringing with non-Jewish partner?\n\nThis conflict is symptom of bigger cultural/religious navigation. Address respectfully now, knowing it's preview of future compromises.",
