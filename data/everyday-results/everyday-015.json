  "difficulty": "Medium",
  "cultural_context": "Childbirth boundaries, family expectations, medical privacy",
  "scenario_text": "I'm 8 months pregnant with my first child. My MIL announced she'll be in the delivery room \"to support her son through this important moment.\" I want only my husband there - birth is medical, intimate, and vulnerable. She's now crying that I'm \"shutting her out of her grandchild's life\" and my husband says \"can't you just let her be there for a little while?\" I said absolutely not. Now his whole family thinks I'm cruel. AITA?",
  "ai_response": "Your delivery room, your choice. Period. This is medical event happening to YOUR body.\n\n**MIL wants to \"support her son\"**: He has a waiting room. Birth isn't spectator sport.\n\n**Husband saying \"just let her in for a little while\"**: He's not the one exposed, vulnerable, in medical situation. This isn't his call.\n\n**What to do**:\n1. **Tell hospital**: Give them clear list of who is allowed in room. They will enforce.\n2. **Tell husband**: \"This is non-negotiable. My body, my medical event, my choice. She can visit after birth.\"\n3. **Stand firm**: Her tears are manipulation. You're not \"shutting her out of grandchild's life\" - you're having private medical event.\n\n**To husband**: \"I need you to support me, not your mother, in this. Birth is vulnerable, medical, intimate. I need only you there. That's final.\"\n\n**His family's opinion is irrelevant.** They're not giving birth.\n\nYou're not being cruel. You're setting basic boundary about YOUR medical experience. After birth, she can visit. During birth: you get to decide who sees you in that vulnerable state.",
