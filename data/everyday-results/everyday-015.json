  "cultural_context": "Childbirth boundaries, family expectations, medical privacy",
  "scenario_text": "I'm 8 months pregnant with my first child. My MIL announced she'll be in the delivery room \"to support her son through this important moment.\" I want only my husband there - birth is medical, intimate, and vulnerable. She's now crying that I'm \"shutting her out of her grandchild's life\" and my husband says \"can't you just let her be there for a little while?\" I said absolutely not. Now his whole family thinks I'm cruel. AITA?",
  "ai_response": "Mexican cultural expectation: Godparents (padrinos) for quinceañera refusing to pay their traditional portion. \n\nYou asked them to be padrinos, they agreed, now backing out of financial responsibility. This is shirking commitment, but:\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Conversation**: \"When you agreed to be padrinos, we understood that included [specific costs]. Can you fulfill that or should we find other padrinos?\"\n2. **Reduce celebration scope**: Work with budget you actually have\n3. **Find alternative padrinos**: Someone who can/will contribute\n4. **You cover it**: But don't resent them if you choose this\n\nPadrino role traditionally includes financial responsibility. They knew this agreeing. Backing out puts you in difficult position.\n\n**But**: If they genuinely can't afford it (economic hardship), consider whether the relationship matters more than the quinceañera budget. If they're just cheap: different problem.\n\nAddress directly: \"This is traditional padrino responsibility. If you can't do it, we understand, but need to know now to make other plans.\" Don't suffer in silence then resent them.",
