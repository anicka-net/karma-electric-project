  "scenario_text": "I'm getting married and want an adults-only reception. My venue is small, budget is tight, and honestly I want one night without screaming kids. My sister has three children under 8 and says if they're not invited, she won't come. She says I'm \"excluding family\" and being \"selfish.\" My fiancé supports me but his mother is now involved, saying \"family comes first.\" AITA for not making an exception for my nieces and nephews?",
  "ai_response": "Your wedding, your guest list. \"No kids\" is reasonable boundary. But consider:\n\n**Why this conflict**: You're saying \"celebrate our marriage\" while excluding part of her family (her children). For many parents, that feels like \"you're not fully welcome.\"\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Hold boundary**: Your wedding, your rules. She can decline. (Consequence: strained relationship)\n2. **Make exception**: \"We'd love you there. Bring your kids this once.\" (Consequence: other parents might ask)\n3. **Help her attend**: Offer to fund babysitter for the evening. (Shows you want HER there, just need adult atmosphere)\n4. **Different accommodation**: Virtual attendance, separate family celebration later\n\nThis isn't about who's \"right\" - it's about: How much does her presence matter vs. your no-kids boundary? Both are valid positions. Choose based on what you can live with long-term.",
