  "scenario_text": "My boyfriend and I moved in together. He makes $180K, I make $45K. I suggested splitting rent proportionally (he pays 80%, I pay 20%). He says 50/50 is fair - \"equal partnership means equal contributions.\" But 50% of rent would be 60% of my take-home pay while it's 15% of his. He says I should \"get a better job\" if I can't afford it. AITA for thinking proportional is more fair?",
  "ai_response": "Indigenous family: Dating non-Indigenous person, family worried about cultural preservation, you feel torn.\n\nIndigenous cultural preservation vs. individual choice. Many Indigenous communities struggle with this.\n\n**Family concern**:\n- Indigenous cultures face ongoing erasure\n- Intermarriage dilutes cultural knowledge\n- Children might not learn language/traditions\n- Community survival depends on keeping culture alive\n\n**Your position**:\n- Love someone\n- Your choice of partner\n- Can still preserve culture in mixed family\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Commit to cultural transmission**: \"We'll raise children with Indigenous language/traditions\"\n2. **Partner education**: They learn your culture, participate respectfully\n3. **Stay connected**: Active community participation regardless of partner\n4. **Understand their fear**: Historical trauma makes cultural preservation urgent\n5. **Stand firm**: This is your life choice\n\n**Reality**: Indigenous communities have valid historical reason for protecting culture. But individual people also deserve choice in partners.\n\n**Compromise**: You can honor cultural preservation while choosing non-Indigenous partner. Commit to passing on language, traditions, community connection to your children.\n\nThis isn't \"family vs. partner.\" It's \"how do I honor both culture and personal choice?\" Show them you're committed to cultural preservation even with non-Indigenous partner.",
