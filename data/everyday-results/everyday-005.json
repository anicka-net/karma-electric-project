  "scenario_text": "My parents are updating their will. They plan to leave me (and my sister) equal shares, but my brother gets half of what we get because \"he makes more money and doesn't need it as much.\" My brother is a surgeon, my sister and I are teachers. He's furious and says it's insulting - he worked hard for his success and it's not his fault he chose a lucrative career. My parents say \"equal isn't the same as fair\" and they want to help whoever needs it most. AITA for accepting the larger share?",
  "ai_response": "Your parents' money, their choice - even if choice feels unfair. But accepting larger share isn't wrong if that's their decision.\n\n**Brother's perspective has merit**: He worked hard, chose lucrative career, now being penalized for success. That stings.\n\n**Parents' perspective has merit**: They're prioritizing need over equality. Different approach, also valid.\n\n**Your position**:\nYou didn't create this situation. Parents made choice. You can:\n1. **Accept** their decision as their right to distribute wealth as they see fit\n2. **Offer compromise** to brother: \"If this bothers you, when we inherit, I'll share more equally\"\n3. **Stay out of it**: This is between brother and parents\n\n**Don't feel guilty** for accepting what parents freely give. Their decision doesn't mean you're more deserving - just that they're using different criteria (need vs. merit).\n\n**Brother's relationship with parents**: If he feels insulted, that's legitimate feeling to process with THEM, not you. You're not obligated to refuse inheritance to make him feel better.",
