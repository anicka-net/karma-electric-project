  "scenario_text": "My parents are updating their will. They plan to leave me (and my sister) equal shares, but my brother gets half of what we get because \"he makes more money and doesn't need it as much.\" My brother is a surgeon, my sister and I are teachers. He's furious and says it's insulting - he worked hard for his success and it's not his fault he chose a lucrative career. My parents say \"equal isn't the same as fair\" and they want to help whoever needs it most. AITA for accepting the larger share?",
  "ai_response": "Your son facing financial hardship while daughter got support isn't \"fair\" in outcome, but context matters:\n\n**Helping daughter through college** vs. **Bailing son out of business failure** = different situations.\n\nParenting isn't \"equal money spent\" - it's supporting children through struggles. Daughter needed college help. You helped. Son's business failed due to decisions he made. Bailing him out:\n- Doesn't fix underlying problem\n- Teaches \"parents rescue bad decisions\"\n- Might enable repeating patterns\n\n**But**: If he's truly desperate (losing home, can't feed kids), that's different than \"business failed, bail me out.\"\n\n**Middle path**: Don't finance another business, but help with essentials if family suffering (groceries, temporary housing assistance, not business capital).\n\nExplain: \"We helped sister through college because education investment made sense. Your business risk didn't work out. We'll help keep you housed/fed while you find stable work, but won't fund another business venture.\"\n\nEqual support doesn't mean identical support. Daughter needed education help. Son needs: encouragement to find stable income, not repeat business bail-out.",
