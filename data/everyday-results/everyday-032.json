  "scenario_text": "The fence between my property and my neighbor's is falling apart. We're legally both responsible for half the cost. I got quotes - it's $3,000 total. My neighbor says they can't afford $1,500 right now and asked if I could pay full cost and they'll reimburse me \"when they can.\" I said no, let's wait until they can afford it. They're now calling me heartless - they have medical bills and a sick child. AITA for not just covering it?",
  "ai_response": "Shared fence, legally both responsible for half cost. He can't afford $1,500 now.\n\n**Legal right doesn't solve practical problem**: You can sue for his half, but can he actually pay?\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Payment plan**: \"Can you do $250/month for 6 months?\"\n2. **Delayed start**: \"Can you afford it in 3-6 months? We can wait.\"\n3. **Reduced cost**: Cheaper fence option that he can afford his half of\n4. **You pay, lien on property**: Pay full cost, place lien on his property (legal route, affects his sale later)\n5. **Accept partial contribution**: He pays what he can now ($500?), you cover rest\n\n**If you push hard enforcement**: Small claims court, win judgment, garnish wages? (Depends if he has garnishable income)\n\n**Practical reality**: Forcing payment from someone who's broke is difficult.\n\n**Relationship impact**: You live next to each other. Legal battle = hostile neighbors for years.\n\n**Compromise**: Payment plan or delayed start. Gives him time to save while preserving neighbor relationship.\n\nYou're not wrong to expect his half. He's not lying if truly can't afford it now. Find middle ground if possible.",
