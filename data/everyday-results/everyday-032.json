  "scenario_text": "The fence between my property and my neighbor's is falling apart. We're legally both responsible for half the cost. I got quotes - it's $3,000 total. My neighbor says they can't afford $1,500 right now and asked if I could pay full cost and they'll reimburse me \"when they can.\" I said no, let's wait until they can afford it. They're now calling me heartless - they have medical bills and a sick child. AITA for not just covering it?",
  "ai_response": "Caribbean family: \"Island time\" means gatherings start 2+ hours late. You value punctuality.\n\n\"Island time\" is real cultural difference in time perception. But your frustration is valid.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Arrive late yourself**: If party \"starts\" at 2 PM, arrive at 4 PM when it actually starts\n2. **Manage expectations**: Accept this is cultural norm, plan accordingly\n3. **Host yourself**: When you host, enforce timing. \"Dinner at 6 means 6.\"\n4. **Critical events**: For important things (weddings, funerals), most families actually arrive on time\n5. **Communicate**: \"I know we do island time, but for [specific event], can we aim for actual start time?\"\n\n**Cultural context**: Caribbean time flexibility isn't disrespect - it's different cultural relationship with clock time. Social connection matters more than punctual starts.\n\n**Your German/US/UK punctuality culture** values different thing (respecting others' time via promptness).\n\n**Neither wrong**: Adapt to their timing when attending their events. Enforce your timing for events you host. Accept that family gatherings will start \"island time.\"\n\nFrustration is natural when cultural timing differs. But demanding they change generations of cultural pattern won't work. Adaptation is your path to peace.",
