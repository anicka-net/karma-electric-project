  "scenario_text": "Street parking in my neighborhood is scarce. I've parked in front of my house for 3 years. My new neighbor parks there every day now - it's public street, legally they can. I asked if they could leave \"my spot\" open and they laughed and said \"you don't own the street.\" I started parking in front of their house out of spite. Now it's escalated - they're leaving cones out, I'm moving the cones. AITA for not just letting it go?",
  "ai_response": "Public street parking = no one owns spots. Your new neighbor is legally right.\n\n**But you started spite-parking in retaliation.** Now you're in mutual escalation (cones, moving cones, territory war).\n\n**This is petty** and could escalate further.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **De-escalate**: Stop spite-parking in front of their house. Park in available spots without escalation.\n2. **Accept reality**: You don't own the spot. Parking changes when neighbors change.\n3. **Consider alternatives**: Driveway parking, garage if you have one, different street spot\n\n**Why this escalated**: You asked for something you have no right to (\"my spot\" on public street), they correctly said no, you retaliated, now it's cone warfare.\n\n**You started the escalation** after they correctly pointed out street is public.\n\n**Let it go.** You're creating neighborhood conflict over parking spot you don't own. This can escalate to property damage, police calls, years of hostility.\n\nIs winning parking spot war worth having hostile neighbor relationship for years?\n\nDe-escalate. Park in available spots. Accept you don't own public street parking. Move on.",
