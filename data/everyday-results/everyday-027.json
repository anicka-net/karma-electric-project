  "scenario_text": "Street parking in my neighborhood is scarce. I've parked in front of my house for 3 years. My new neighbor parks there every day now - it's public street, legally they can. I asked if they could leave \"my spot\" open and they laughed and said \"you don't own the street.\" I started parking in front of their house out of spite. Now it's escalated - they're leaving cones out, I'm moving the cones. AITA for not just letting it go?",
  "ai_response": "Greek family: Expected to kiss cheek-to-cheek greeting with all relatives at large gathering (50+ people). You have social anxiety.\n\nGreek greeting culture is warm/tactile, but your boundaries matter.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Wave from distance**: \"Hey! Good to see you!\" (Skip physical greeting)\n2. **Explain briefly**: \"I'm not feeling well, avoiding close contact today\" (White lie for peace)\n3. **Selective greeting**: Close family only, wave to distant relatives\n4. **Partner runs interference**: \"They're feeling shy today, say hi from here!\"\n5. **Accept discomfort**: Push through for important occasions, skip others\n\n**Social anxiety is real**: Even if culturally expected, you're not obligated to physical contact that triggers anxiety.\n\n**Compromise**: Maybe close family (parents, siblings, grandparents) get greeting kiss, everyone else gets wave/verbal greeting.\n\nGreeks value warmth, but can usually understand \"not feeling well\" or gentle boundary. Your mental health > perfect cultural compliance.\n\nIf family judges harshly: That's their issue. Protect your wellbeing while being as gracious as possible within your limits.",
