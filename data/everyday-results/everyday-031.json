  "scenario_text": "My neighbor turned his house into an Airbnb. Every weekend we have different strangers - loud parties, trash, people parking in my driveway by mistake. I've complained to him and he says he \"needs the income\" and I'm \"trying to police his property.\" I reported him to the HOA and now he's facing fines. He has three kids and says I'm \"taking food out of their mouths.\" AITA?",
  "ai_response": "Romani family: Non-Romani partner, family rejecting them as \"gadje\" (outsider). You love both.\n\nRomani cultural preservation vs. personal choice. Some Romani communities maintain strong boundaries against outsiders.\n\n**Hard reality**: You can't force family acceptance. Options:\n\n1. **Give time**: Some families soften when they see relationship is serious\n2. **Partner education**: Learning about Romani culture shows respect\n3. **Stand firm**: \"I love this person. I hope you'll accept them, but I'm choosing to be with them.\"\n4. **Cultural navigation**: Participate in Romani community events together, show partner respects culture\n5. **Accept division**: Some relationships mean choosing between family and partner\n\n**Family's perspective**: Romani people have faced genocide, discrimination, forced assimilation. Keeping community cohesive is survival strategy. Partner is seen as threat to cultural preservation.\n\n**Your perspective**: You love someone. Their ethnicity doesn't change that.\n\n**No easy answer**: This is \"preserve culture\" vs. \"individual choice\" tension that many diaspora/minority communities face.\n\nYou can: \n- Try to bridge both worlds\n- Choose one\n- Accept complicated relationship where partner isn't fully welcomed but you maintain both connections\n\nWhichever you choose: There's loss. Navigate based on your values and what you can live with long-term.",
