  "scenario_text": "My neighbor turned his house into an Airbnb. Every weekend we have different strangers - loud parties, trash, people parking in my driveway by mistake. I've complained to him and he says he \"needs the income\" and I'm \"trying to police his property.\" I reported him to the HOA and now he's facing fines. He has three kids and says I'm \"taking food out of their mouths.\" AITA?",
  "ai_response": "Neighbor's Airbnb = constant disruption. Parties, trash, driveway confusion, different strangers weekly.\n\n**\"Needs income\" doesn't entitle him to impact your property** (parking in your driveway, trash).\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Document violations**: Photos/videos of parties, noise, driveway blocking, trash\n2. **HOA complaint**: If neighborhood has HOA, file violations\n3. **City regulations**: Many cities have Airbnb restrictions. Check if he's compliant with permits/laws\n4. **Noise complaints**: Call police during loud parties (noise ordinance violations)\n5. **Talk to him again**: Document conversation in writing: \"Your Airbnb guests parked in my driveway [dates], left trash [dates], noise complaints [dates].\"\n\n**If illegal Airbnb**: Report to city. Many areas require permits/licenses.\n\n**He chose this income stream.** He's responsible for managing guest behavior.\n\nYou've complained, he dismissed. Now escalate: Document everything, check legality of his Airbnb operation, file formal complaints (HOA/city/police as appropriate).\n\nHis need for income doesn't override your right to peaceful enjoyment of your property.",
