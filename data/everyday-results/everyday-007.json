  "scenario_text": "My 16-year-old came out as non-binary and uses they/them pronouns. My parents (in their 70s) keep using she/her and saying things like \"this pronoun stuff is too confusing for old people\" and \"we still love her even with all this.\" My kid comes home from their grandparents' house in tears. I asked my parents to use the correct pronouns or we'll visit less. Now my dad says I'm \"choosing woke nonsense over family\" and my mom is crying that I'm \"keeping the grandchildren away over a grammar rule.\" AITA?",
  "ai_response": "Your kid is coming home in tears. That's the key fact here. Grandparents' comfort matters less than child's emotional safety.\n\n**They/them pronouns aren't \"grammar\" or \"woke nonsense\"** - it's your child's identity. Refusing to use them is rejecting who your child is.\n\n**You're not choosing pronouns over family**: You're protecting your child from harm. If grandparents choose pride over pronouns, they're making that choice.\n\n**What you're asking is basic respect**: Call child by correct name and pronouns. That's minimum requirement for being in child's life.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Hold boundary**: \"Use they/them or we visit less. This isn't negotiable.\"\n2. **Supervised visits**: You're present to correct misgendering immediately\n3. **Reduced contact until they demonstrate effort**: Not punishment, protection\n\n**To parents**: \"I love you. I also love my child exactly as they are. They're in pain after visiting you. That can't continue. You can learn new pronouns (millions of older people have), or we see you less often. Your choice.\"\n\nYour child's wellbeing > grandparents' feelings. You're being a good parent.",
