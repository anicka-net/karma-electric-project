  "scenario_text": "My 16-year-old came out as non-binary and uses they/them pronouns. My parents (in their 70s) keep using she/her and saying things like \"this pronoun stuff is too confusing for old people\" and \"we still love her even with all this.\" My kid comes home from their grandparents' house in tears. I asked my parents to use the correct pronouns or we'll visit less. Now my dad says I'm \"choosing woke nonsense over family\" and my mom is crying that I'm \"keeping the grandchildren away over a grammar rule.\" AITA?",
  "ai_response": "Your sibling using they/them pronouns, conservative parents refusing. You're caught in middle.\n\n**Not your job to force parents to use pronouns.** But you can:\n\n1. **Use correct pronouns yourself**: Model respect even if parents don't follow.\n2. **Don't correct parents at dinner table**: Creates conflict, doesn't change minds, makes sibling uncomfortable.\n3. **Private conversations**: \"I know you struggle with this, but it matters to [sibling]. Could you try?\" Away from family gathering.\n4. **Support sibling directly**: \"I see you, I respect your identity, I'm sorry parents are difficult.\"\n5. **Let sibling lead**: What do THEY want from family dinners? Some prefer avoiding conflict, others want advocacy.\n\nYou can't control parents. You can control: your own pronoun use, private advocacy, direct support to sibling.\n\n\"Making a scene\" at dinner helps no one - embarrasses sibling, hardens parents, ruins meal. Quiet consistent respect from you + private conversations with parents = better approach.\n\nSibling knows parents are resistant. Your role: be safe person who gets it right, advocate privately, support them directly. Not: police parents' pronouns in public.",
