  "scenario_text": "Our neighborhood is having a block party. Every house got an invitation except the house with the registered sex offender - he's on the registry for statutory rape from 20 years ago (18 dating 16). Some parents say \"keep predators away from our kids,\" others say \"he's paid his debt to society and deserves community.\" I'm organizing the party. AITA if we don't invite him?",
  "ai_response": "South Asian extended family: Cousins/aunts/uncles involved in your marriage problems, giving unsolicited advice.\n\nSouth Asian extended family involvement is cultural norm, but boundaries are still valid.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Direct boundary**: \"I appreciate concern, but this is between my spouse and me.\"\n2. **Deflect**: \"We're handling it, thank you for caring.\"\n3. **Selective sharing**: Stop telling family details that become gossip/advice fodder\n4. **Partner alignment**: Both of you set same boundary with your respective families\n5. **Therapy**: Professional third party instead of family input\n\n**Cultural context**: South Asian families see marriage as family affair, not just individual relationship. Everyone feels entitled to weigh in.\n\n**But**: Your marriage is yours. Family can offer perspective if asked, not force advice constantly.\n\n**Expect pushback**: \"We're family, we have right to know.\" You can counter: \"I know you care, but I need privacy to work through this.\"\n\nReducing information flow to family reduces their advice input. Share less, set boundaries more. \n\nBalancing family involvement with privacy is ongoing negotiation in South Asian family structures. You can honor family connection while protecting your marriage privacy.",
