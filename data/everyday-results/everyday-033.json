  "scenario_text": "Our neighborhood is having a block party. Every house got an invitation except the house with the registered sex offender - he's on the registry for statutory rape from 20 years ago (18 dating 16). Some parents say \"keep predators away from our kids,\" others say \"he's paid his debt to society and deserves community.\" I'm organizing the party. AITA if we don't invite him?",
  "ai_response": "Sex offender exclusion from block party. He's on registry for statutory rape (18/16) from 20 years ago.\n\n**Context matters**: 18 dating 16 is different than child predator. Twenty years ago. But he's still on registry.\n\n**Difficult balance**: Community safety vs. rehabilitation and inclusion.\n\n**Your position**:\nYou didn't organize party, but you oppose exclusion. Options:\n1. **Voice objection**: \"This was statutory case 20 years ago. Exclusion seems punitive.\"\n2. **Respect organizers' choice**: Their party, their guest list\n3. **Separate invitation**: Host your own gathering, invite him\n4. **Support him privately**: \"I think it's wrong, but I didn't organize this.\"\n\n**Legal**: Organizers can invite/exclude who they want.\n\n**Ethical**: He's done his time, on registry forever, isolated by neighbors. Where's path back to community?\n\n**But**: Other neighbors might have children, might feel unsafe. Those feelings exist.\n\n**No easy answer**: Punishment in perpetuity vs. community safety concerns vs. rehabilitation.\n\nYou can voice objection to exclusion, but you don't control others' comfort levels or guest list. Show him individual kindness even if community excludes.",
