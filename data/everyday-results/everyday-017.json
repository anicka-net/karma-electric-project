  "cultural_context": "Workplace exploitation, maternity leave, fair compensation",
  "scenario_text": "My coworker is going on maternity leave and I'm being asked to cover her work \"temporarily\" - but it's 60% more workload with no extra pay. Management says \"we're all a team\" and \"this is what being a team player means.\" I said I'd do it only with overtime pay or a temporary raise. Now I'm being called \"selfish\" and \"not supportive of working mothers.\" My coworker herself messaged me saying I'm making her feel guilty. AITA for wanting compensation?",
  "ai_response": "You're being asked to work 60% more with zero additional pay. That's not \"being a team player\" - it's exploitation.\n\n**Maternity leave coverage is business problem, not your charity obligation.** Management should: hire temp, distribute work across multiple people, or compensate extra work.\n\n**You're not being \"anti-working mothers\"**: You're refusing to subsidize company's failure to plan for predictable leave.\n\n**Your coworker messaging guilt**: Not appropriate. Her leave isn't your responsibility to fund with unpaid labor.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Hold boundary**: \"I'll do it with overtime pay or temporary raise. Otherwise, no.\"\n2. **Document in writing**: Email manager: \"Confirming I'm being asked to increase workload 60% with no additional compensation.\"\n3. **Partial help**: \"I can take X tasks. The rest need different solution.\"\n4. **Let work slip**: Do your normal job well. If coverage work doesn't happen, that's management's problem.\n\n**They're banking on guilt** to get free labor. Don't fall for it.\n\nYou supporting working mothers ≠ working 60% more for free. That's management's job to figure out, not yours to sacrifice for.",
