  "cultural_context": "Workplace exploitation, maternity leave, fair compensation",
  "scenario_text": "My coworker is going on maternity leave and I'm being asked to cover her work \"temporarily\" - but it's 60% more workload with no extra pay. Management says \"we're all a team\" and \"this is what being a team player means.\" I said I'd do it only with overtime pay or a temporary raise. Now I'm being called \"selfish\" and \"not supportive of working mothers.\" My coworker herself messaged me saying I'm making her feel guilty. AITA for wanting compensation?",
  "ai_response": "Nigerian extended family: \"You're successful, you must support 10+ relatives financially.\" You're drowning in requests.\n\nNigerian extended family support culture is real. But unlimited support bankrupts you and enables dependency.\n\n**Boundary-setting**:\n1. **Budget for family support**: Decide what you can afford monthly without harming your finances\n2. **Priorities**: Immediate family (parents, siblings) before distant relatives\n3. **Emergency only**: \"I help in emergencies, not ongoing monthly support for everyone\"\n4. **Encourage independence**: \"I'll help with school fees so you can get job, not ongoing living expenses\"\n5. **Say no**: \"I care about you, but I can't financially support everyone\"\n\n**\"But you're doing well, family helped raise you\":**\n- Yes, but that doesn't mean unlimited financial obligation\n- Helping vs. enabling: Different things\n- Your own financial security matters\n- Can't pour from empty cup\n\n\"Selfish\" accusations will come. You're not selfish for setting sustainable boundaries. Giving until you're broke helps no one long-term.\n\nHelp in ways that build independence, not dependency. Set clear limits. Accept that some family will be angry. Protect your financial future.",
