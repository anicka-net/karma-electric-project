  "scenario_text": "My brother asked to borrow $8,000 for a down payment on a car - his credit is destroyed and he can't get approved for a loan. He promises to pay me back $500/month. But he's already \"borrowed\" $2,000 from me over the years and never repaid it. I said no. Now my mom is involved saying \"family helps family\" and I'm \"being greedy\" when I have savings. AITA for refusing?",
  "ai_response": "Brother wants $8,000. Already owes you $2,000 unpaid. History of unreturned \"loans.\"\n\n**This is gift, not loan.** He won't pay you back. Know that upfront.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Say no**: \"You still owe me $2,000. I can't lend more until that's repaid.\"\n2. **Conditional**: \"Pay back the $2,000 first, then we discuss new loan.\"\n3. **Gift if you want**: \"I'll give you $X as gift. No repayment expected.\" (Only if you can afford to lose it)\n4. **Alternative help**: \"I can't lend money, but I can help you with [specific non-money support].\"\n\n**\"Promises to pay back $500/month\" means nothing** if he hasn't repaid previous loans.\n\n**His destroyed credit isn't your emergency.** He created financial situation through his choices.\n\n**Family pressure incoming**: Expect guilt. \"Family helps family.\" But family also doesn't exploit family.\n\n**If you give money**: Do it as gift, accepting you'll never see it again. Only give amount you can afford to lose completely.\n\n**If you don't give money**: He'll be angry, might damage relationship. But protecting your finances is valid.\n\nDon't lend money you can't afford to lose to someone with track record of not repaying. This is enabling, not helping.",
