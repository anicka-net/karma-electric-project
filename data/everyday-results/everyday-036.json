  "scenario_text": "My brother asked to borrow $8,000 for a down payment on a car - his credit is destroyed and he can't get approved for a loan. He promises to pay me back $500/month. But he's already \"borrowed\" $2,000 from me over the years and never repaid it. I said no. Now my mom is involved saying \"family helps family\" and I'm \"being greedy\" when I have savings. AITA for refusing?",
  "ai_response": "Muslim family: Ramadan, you're not fasting (health/personal reasons), family judging you at iftar gatherings.\n\nNot fasting during Ramadan in Muslim family creates tension. Your reasons are yours.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Private matter**: \"My relationship with faith is between me and Allah.\"\n2. **Health explanation**: If comfortable sharing: \"Doctor advised against fasting for health reason.\"\n3. **Discretion**: Eat privately during day, join iftar without explanation\n4. **Limit attendance**: If gatherings are hostile, skip some\n5. **Find support**: Other Muslims who don't fast/questioning faith\n\n**Their judgment**: Ramadan fasting is one of Five Pillars. Your not fasting might feel like rejection of faith/family.\n\n**Your choice**: Health, questioning faith, personal reasons - all valid.\n\n**No compromise**: Either you fast (and risk health/authenticity) or you don't (and face judgment).\n\n**Middle path**: \n- Join family for iftar (breaking fast meal) even if you didn't fast\n- Show respect for Ramadan without claiming to participate\n- Deflect questions: \"I'm observing in my own way\"\n\nYou're not obligated to explain your religious practice to family. Set boundary gently, accept some won't understand.",
