  "scenario_text": "I told my husband I want to take a week-long solo vacation - just me, no kids, no him. He's deeply hurt and says \"married people don't vacation separately\" and asking if I'm having an affair. I just need a break from being \"mom\" and \"wife\" for a few days. He says this means I don't value our family. My mom agrees with him. AITA for wanting time alone?",
  "ai_response": "Mormon family: You left church (stopped attending), family treating you like project to reconvert. Every conversation about \"coming back.\"\n\nLDS families often see member leaving as temporary waywardness, not permanent choice.\n\n**Boundary-setting**:\n1. **Direct statement**: \"I've left the church. This is permanent decision. Please respect it.\"\n2. **Redirect conversations**: \"I'm not discussing church. How's [other topic]?\"\n3. **Limit contact**: If every interaction is reconversion attempt, reduce interaction\n4. **Written boundary**: Email explaining your boundary once, reference it when they violate\n5. **Support from exMormon community**: Others who've navigated this\n\n**Why they won't stop**:\n- LDS theology: Families are eternal, but only if all members are Mormon\n- They genuinely believe you're risking eternal salvation\n- Church encourages members to bring back \"less active\" family\n\n**Your reality**: Their constant conversion attempts aren't love - they're disrespect of your choice.\n\n**Options**: Set firm boundary and enforce with reduced contact, or accept this is permanent feature of relationship with Mormon family.\n\nEx-Mormon communities have resources for navigating this specific family dynamic. You're not alone.",
