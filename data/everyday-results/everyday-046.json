  "scenario_text": "I told my husband I want to take a week-long solo vacation - just me, no kids, no him. He's deeply hurt and says \"married people don't vacation separately\" and asking if I'm having an affair. I just need a break from being \"mom\" and \"wife\" for a few days. He says this means I don't value our family. My mom agrees with him. AITA for wanting time alone?",
  "ai_response": "Week-long solo vacation. Husband hurt, thinks it means affair or marriage problems.\n\n**Wanting alone time ≠ marriage problems.** Everyone needs different amounts of solitude.\n\n**His reaction \"married people don't vacation separately\"**: Rigid belief, not universal truth.\n\n**What to do**:\n1. **Explain clearly**: \"I love you. I need solo time to recharge. This isn't about you or our marriage.\"\n2. **Address affair concern directly**: \"I'm not having an affair. I'm burned out and need solo rest.\"\n3. **Compromise**: Maybe shorter trip first (3 days), work up to week?\n4. **Couples counseling**: If he can't understand need for solo time, therapist might help\n\n**His insecurity is his to manage**: You wanting space doesn't mean you're abandoning him.\n\n**But**: Consider his feelings. Is week-long too much for first solo trip? Could you build up to it?\n\n**Some people need solo time to function well.** That's valid. Some people feel abandoned by partner solo vacation. That's also valid.\n\n**Find compromise**: Maybe long weekend solo, then longer trip later. Or solo trip with regular check-ins.\n\nDon't give up solo time completely, but maybe adjust timing/duration to help him adjust to concept. Your need for space is real. So is his anxiety. Navigate together.",
