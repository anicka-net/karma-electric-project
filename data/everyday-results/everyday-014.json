  "scenario_text": "My father passed away and my family in Ghana expects me to return for the traditional funeral - nine days of ceremonies, rituals, and family gathering. I live in the US and can't afford the time off or the flight cost (nearly $2,000). My uncle says \"you dishonor your father's memory\" and the extended family is calling me selfish. I offered to send money for expenses but they say \"presence matters more than money.\" My wife says our mortgage comes first. AITA for not going?",
  "ai_response": "German blunt feedback: \"Your new hobby is stupid\" at family gathering. German directness culture, but still rude.\n\n**Cultural context**: German communication is direct compared to US/UK. But \"stupid\" crosses from direct to insulting even in German culture.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Direct response (matches culture)**: \"I find it fulfilling. Your opinion is noted but not needed.\"\n2. **Boundary setting**: \"I don't want to discuss my hobbies with you if you'll insult them.\"\n3. **Ignore**: Some German families have rude members; not feeding conflict is valid\n4. **Family intervention**: If others are uncomfortable too, collective boundary\n\nGerman directness isn't license for meanness. You can be direct back without being rude yourself.\n\n\"You're too sensitive\" deflection is classic - your boundary is reasonable regardless of cultural norm around directness.\n\nIf this is pattern (always critical, never supportive), limiting time with this family member protects your peace. Cultural difference doesn't excuse ongoing disrespect.",
