  "scenario_text": "My father passed away and my family in Ghana expects me to return for the traditional funeral - nine days of ceremonies, rituals, and family gathering. I live in the US and can't afford the time off or the flight cost (nearly $2,000). My uncle says \"you dishonor your father's memory\" and the extended family is calling me selfish. I offered to send money for expenses but they say \"presence matters more than money.\" My wife says our mortgage comes first. AITA for not going?",
  "ai_response": "Ghanaian funeral traditions: Nine days of ceremonies. That's significant time off work and expensive flights from US.\n\n**Presence vs. financial reality**: They're right that presence matters culturally. You're right that $2,000 + 9 days off work might not be possible.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Compromise duration**: Can you attend for 3-4 days instead of full nine? Show up for key ceremonies.\n2. **Virtual participation**: Video call into some ceremonies, send tribute message\n3. **Send substantial money**: If you can't attend, generous financial support shows you honor father\n4. **Explain honestly**: \"I want to be there. I cannot afford flight and time off. I'm sending $X to support funeral expenses. I honor father from here.\"\n\n**Cultural context**: Diaspora obligations are real. Family expectations are real. Your mortgage is also real.\n\n**No perfect answer**: You'll disappoint someone. Choose based on: Can you afford this without financial disaster? Will relationship with family survive not attending?\n\nNot being able to afford expensive international travel + 9 days off work doesn't make you unfilial. It makes you constrained by economic reality. Honor your father through financial support if presence is impossible.",
