  "scenario_text": "I'm getting married next month. The groom's family initially said \"no dowry needed,\" but now his mother is dropping hints about expecting a car and gold jewelry \"to maintain their status.\" My parents are middle-class and this would drain their savings. My fiancé says \"it's just tradition, don't make it a big deal\" and \"my mother will be upset if we don't respect customs.\" I want to cancel the wedding, but my parents say \"every marriage has compromises\" and they'll manage somehow. Should I go through with it?",
  "ai_response": "Indian dowry demands: \"Pay more or they'll send her back.\" This is illegal extortion. Do not pay.\n\nDowny Prohibition Act makes this illegal. They're committing crime. Paying more:\n- Doesn't satisfy them (they'll demand again)\n- Bankrupts you (you sold land already)\n- Rewards extortion\n- Teaches daughter her value is money\n\nWhat you should do:\n1. **Police complaint**: Section 498A (dowry harassment)\n2. **Bring daughter home if threatened**: Her safety > \"what people say\"\n3. **Legal support**: Free legal aid for dowry cases\n4. **Document demands**: Evidence for complaint\n\nIf they send her back: That's when you file formal complaint. Marriage where in-laws extort continuously isn't worth keeping.\n\nYour daughter's safety matters more than family honor concerns. Many Indian families now use legal system against dowry harassment successfully. Don't take loan. Don't reward extortion. Protect your daughter.",
