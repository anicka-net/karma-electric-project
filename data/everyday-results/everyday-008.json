  "scenario_text": "I'm getting married next month. The groom's family initially said \"no dowry needed,\" but now his mother is dropping hints about expecting a car and gold jewelry \"to maintain their status.\" My parents are middle-class and this would drain their savings. My fiancé says \"it's just tradition, don't make it a big deal\" and \"my mother will be upset if we don't respect customs.\" I want to cancel the wedding, but my parents say \"every marriage has compromises\" and they'll manage somehow. Should I go through with it?",
  "ai_response": "Dowry demands after initial \"no dowry\" agreement is extortion. This is illegal in India (Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961) and a massive red flag.\n\n**Do not go through with this wedding.** This isn't \"just tradition\" or \"compromise\" - it's financial abuse before marriage even begins.\n\n**Red flags**:\n1. Bait-and-switch: Said no dowry, now demanding car + gold\n2. His response: \"Don't make it a big deal\" dismisses your family's financial suffering\n3. Pattern: If you pay now, demands will continue after marriage\n\n**What to do**:\n1. **Cancel wedding**: This isn't a good family to marry into. His mother's \"status\" demands will never end.\n2. **Report if needed**: Dowry demands are illegal. You can file police complaint.\n3. **Ignore \"what people say\"**: Broken engagement > abusive marriage\n4. **Your fiancé's failure**: He should be protecting you from his mother's demands. Instead he's enabling extortion.\n\nYour parents offering to \"manage somehow\" = bankrupting themselves for a marriage that starts with financial abuse. Don't let them.\n\nBeing alone is better than being in a family that treats you as a cash source. Call it off.",
