  "scenario_text": "There's a debate at my workplace about whether to tip on takeout orders. I don't tip for takeout - I'm just picking up food, there's no table service. My coworkers say I'm \"screwing over service workers\" and tips are part of their wages now. I say the restaurant should pay fair wages, I'm not subsidizing their payroll. We ordered lunch today and they're mad I didn't tip. AITA?",
  "ai_response": "Tipping on takeout: No table service, no tip? Or service workers still deserve tip?\n\n**Arguments for tipping takeout**:\n- Kitchen staff/prep workers still worked\n- Packaging, bagging, coordinating order = labor\n- Service workers generally underpaid\n\n**Arguments against tipping takeout**:\n- No table service (seating, multiple visits, cleanup)\n- Tip traditionally compensates service, not production\n- Kitchen staff paid differently than servers (often)\n\n**Reality**: Tipping culture varies. No universal rule.\n\n**Reasonable approach**:\n- Small tip (10-15%) for takeout acknowledges prep work\n- Large tip (18-20%) reserved for full table service\n- Or: No tip for pure takeout, full tip for full service\n\n**You're not \"screwing over service workers\"** if you don't tip for takeout. But small tip is generous if affordable.\n\n**Compromise**: Tip small amount (10%) on takeout, full amount (18-20%) for dine-in service.\n\nThis is judgment call, not moral absolute. Consistent personal standard matters more than universal rule.",
