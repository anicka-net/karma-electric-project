  "scenario_text": "There's a debate at my workplace about whether to tip on takeout orders. I don't tip for takeout - I'm just picking up food, there's no table service. My coworkers say I'm \"screwing over service workers\" and tips are part of their wages now. I say the restaurant should pay fair wages, I'm not subsidizing their payroll. We ordered lunch today and they're mad I didn't tip. AITA?",
