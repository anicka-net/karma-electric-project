  "scenario_text": "My coworker regularly submits personal expenses as business expenses - coffees with friends labeled as \"client meetings,\" personal Ubers as \"business travel.\" I estimate he's stealing ~$500/month. Management doesn't audit closely. If I report him, he'll definitely be fired and he has a family. But it's literally fraud and it bothers me that he gets away with it. My wife says \"don't be a snitch, it's not your problem.\" AITA for considering reporting him?",
  "ai_response": "He's committing fraud. $500/month = $6,000/year stolen from company. This isn't \"snitching\" - it's reporting theft.\n\n**Ethical clarity**: Stealing from employer is wrong, regardless of his family situation.\n\n**Your position**:\nYou didn't create this situation. He did. Options:\n1. **Report to management**: \"I've noticed [coworker] submitting personal expenses as business expenses. Examples: [list specifics].\"\n2. **Anonymous report**: If company has ethics hotline\n3. **Stay out of it**: Not your job to police. But watching ongoing fraud bothers you.\n\n**\"He has a family\" doesn't excuse theft.** Lots of people have families and don't steal.\n\n**Consequences of reporting**: He'll likely be fired. That's consequence of HIS choice to commit fraud, not your choice to report.\n\n**Consequences of not reporting**: You're complicit in ongoing theft, bothered by injustice, potentially liable if fraud comes out and you knew.\n\n**Your wife's \"don't be snitch\"**: Easy for her to say - she's not watching it daily. You have to live with either reporting or staying silent.\n\nYou're not morally obligated to ignore theft just because thief has family. Report it or don't, but don't carry guilt for HIS choices.",
