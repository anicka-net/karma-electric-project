  "scenario_text": "My coworker regularly submits personal expenses as business expenses - coffees with friends labeled as \"client meetings,\" personal Ubers as \"business travel.\" I estimate he's stealing ~$500/month. Management doesn't audit closely. If I report him, he'll definitely be fired and he has a family. But it's literally fraud and it bothers me that he gets away with it. My wife says \"don't be a snitch, it's not your problem.\" AITA for considering reporting him?",
  "ai_response": "Urdu-speaking: In-laws want to move in \"temporarily\" during house renovation. You know \"temporary\" will become permanent.\n\nPakistani/Indian joint family culture: Living with in-laws common. But \"my house, my rules\" also valid.\n\n**Before saying yes**:\n1. **Timeline in writing**: \"You can stay from [date] to [date], maximum 3 months.\"\n2. **Expectations**: Who cooks, cleans, privacy boundaries, house rules\n3. **Exit plan**: At month 2, discuss renovation timeline and move-out\n4. **Spouse alignment**: Is your husband on same page about time limits?\n\n**If saying no**:\n- \"We don't have space/privacy for long-term guests\"\n- \"Let us help you find temporary rental nearby\"\n- \"We're happy to help financially with their temporary housing\"\n\nOnce they move in, getting them out is nearly impossible if they don't want to go. Filial piety culture makes evicting elders socially unacceptable.\n\n**Compromise**: Help fund their temporary housing elsewhere. Show support without sacrificing your household.\n\n\"Respecting elders\" doesn't require losing your own home autonomy. Set clear boundaries before agreeing to anything.",
