  "scenario_text": "My office has a lottery pool - everyone chips in $5/week. Last week I forgot to pay in. This week our pool won $50,000. They're saying I don't get a share because I didn't pay that week. I've paid in for 2+ years (over $500). They say \"rules are rules.\" I think this is unfair for one missed payment. AITA for arguing I should get a share?",
