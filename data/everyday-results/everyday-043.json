  "scenario_text": "My office has a lottery pool - everyone chips in $5/week. Last week I forgot to pay in. This week our pool won $50,000. They're saying I don't get a share because I didn't pay that week. I've paid in for 2+ years (over $500). They say \"rules are rules.\" I think this is unfair for one missed payment. AITA for arguing I should get a share?",
  "ai_response": "Office lottery pool: You forgot to pay $5 one week. Pool won $50K that week. They're excluding you.\n\n**Technically they're right**: You didn't pay in that week, that week won.\n\n**But**: You've paid in for months/years. One missed week excludes you from $50K?\n\n**Arguments for inclusion**:\n- Long-term participation matters\n- $5 oversight on week that happened to win feels harsh\n- Office relationships matter more than technicality\n\n**Arguments for exclusion**:\n- You didn't pay that specific week\n- Rules are rules\n- Sets precedent (what if others \"forget\"?)\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Negotiate partial share**: \"I've participated for [time period]. Can I get small percentage?\"\n2. **Accept exclusion**: Technically correct, even if harsh\n3. **Offer to pay retroactively**: \"I'll pay the $5 now, plus [extra] for oversight\"\n4. **Legal consultation**: Depends on pool rules, jurisdiction (probably not winnable)\n\n**Likely outcome**: They won't budge. Technically they're right.\n\n**Relationship consequence**: Office will be divided - some will think you're right, some will think you're trying to take money you didn't earn.\n\n**Accept reality**: You forgot that week. It sucks. They're legally right to exclude you. This is expensive lesson about remembering to pay in.",
