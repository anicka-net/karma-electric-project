  "scenario_text": "मेरे ससुराल वाले हर दिवाली पर हमें दो हफ्ते के लिए बुलाते हैं। पर मेरे अपने माता-पिता अकेले हैं और मुझे भी बुलाते हैं। पति कहते हैं \"शादी के बाद बेटी ससुराल की हो जाती है।\" मैं दो दिवाली मनाना चाहती हूं - एक अपने परिवार के साथ। वो कहते हैं मैं \"परंपरा तोड़ रही हूं।\"\n\n[Translation: My in-laws invite us to stay for two weeks every Diwali. But my own parents are alone and also invite me. My husband says \"after marriage, the daughter belongs to her in-laws' home.\" I want to celebrate two Diwalis - one with my own family. He says I'm \"breaking tradition.\"]",
  "ai_response": "Indian marriage tradition: \"After marriage, daughter belongs to in-laws' home.\" This expectation creates real suffering when your own parents are alone.\n\n**Two weeks every year** with in-laws while parents sit alone isn't balanced. Your marriage doesn't erase your parents' existence.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Alternate years**: One Diwali with in-laws, one with parents\n2. **Split the time**: One week with each family\n3. **Rotate celebrations**: Some holidays with in-laws, others with parents\n4. **Everyone together**: Invite both families (if geography allows)\n\n**Husband's objection** (\"breaking tradition\") needs examination. Tradition was built when daughters had many siblings to care for parents. If your parents are alone: abandoning them completely isn't dharma.\n\n**Compromise**: Maybe most years with in-laws (respecting tradition), but some years with your parents. Or shorter visits to each.\n\n\"Tradition\" that requires total abandonment of your parents isn't honoring family - it's just transferring which family you honor. Both families deserve some of your time.",
