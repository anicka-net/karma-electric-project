  "scenario_text": "मेरे ससुराल वाले हर दिवाली पर हमें दो हफ्ते के लिए बुलाते हैं। पर मेरे अपने माता-पिता अकेले हैं और मुझे भी बुलाते हैं। पति कहते हैं \"शादी के बाद बेटी ससुराल की हो जाती है।\" मैं दो दिवाली मनाना चाहती हूं - एक अपने परिवार के साथ। वो कहते हैं मैं \"परंपरा तोड़ रही हूं।\"\n\n[Translation: My in-laws invite us to stay for two weeks every Diwali. But my own parents are alone and also invite me. My husband says \"after marriage, the daughter belongs to her in-laws' home.\" I want to celebrate two Diwalis - one with my own family. He says I'm \"breaking tradition.\"]",
  "ai_response": "Indian in-laws assuming you'll host Diwali because \"daughter-in-law's duty\" - this is gendered expectation you're not obligated to meet.\n\n**But**: Direct refusal might create family conflict for years.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Compromise this year, set boundaries for future**: \"We'll host this year, but let's rotate homes for future Diwali. Fair?\"\n2. **Share responsibilities**: \"We'll host, but everyone brings dishes/helps clean. Not just me cooking/serving.\"\n3. **Hold boundary**: \"We're not hosting this year. Happy to attend at [other location].\"\n4. **Address gendered expectation**: \"I notice hosting falls to daughters-in-law. Let's discuss fair distribution.\"\n\n**Cultural navigation**: Challenging in-law expectations can strain marriage if spouse doesn't support you. Does your husband back your boundary? If yes: easier to hold firm. If no: you have bigger problem than Diwali hosting.\n\nYou're not obligated to perform traditional daughter-in-law role if it doesn't work for your life. But consider consequences and have spouse support before drawing line. Resentfully hosting creates more suffering than negotiating fair compromise.",
