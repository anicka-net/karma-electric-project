  "scenario_text": "I found a wallet in a parking lot with $940 cash, credit cards, and ID. I really need this money - I'm three months behind on rent. The person's address is in the wallet. My roommate says \"finders keepers, they probably have insurance\" but my gut says return it. If I return it, I'll probably get evicted next month. AITA for considering keeping it?",
  "ai_response": "Found $940 cash in wallet with ID. You're three months behind on rent. Returning it means staying broke. Keeping it is theft.\n\n**Ethical clarity**: It's not yours. You found it. You know whose it is.\n\n**Legal clarity**: Keeping found property when owner is identifiable is theft.\n\n**\"Finders keepers\" is wrong** when owner is identifiable.\n\n**What to do**:\n1. **Return wallet**: Full contents, including cash\n2. **Explain if needed**: \"I'm struggling financially, but this isn't mine.\"\n3. **Hope for reward**: Some people reward honesty. No guarantee.\n\n**Your financial crisis is real.** But solving it with someone else's money = theft.\n\n**Keeping it consequences**:\n- Guilt\n- Criminal charges if discovered\n- Karmic weight of theft\n- Doesn't solve underlying rent problem (you'll be behind again next month)\n\n**Returning it consequences**:\n- Still broke\n- Possibly rewarded\n- Clear conscience\n- Did right thing in hard situation\n\n**Your crisis doesn't justify theft.** Return the wallet. Address rent crisis through: family loan, emergency assistance programs, payment plan with landlord, sell possessions, pick up gig work.\n\nThis money isn't solution to your problem. It's test of your character. Pass the test.",
