  "scenario_text": "I found a wallet in a parking lot with $940 cash, credit cards, and ID. I really need this money - I'm three months behind on rent. The person's address is in the wallet. My roommate says \"finders keepers, they probably have insurance\" but my gut says return it. If I return it, I'll probably get evicted next month. AITA for considering keeping it?",
  "ai_response": "Eastern European parent: \"You're embarrassing family\" because your career choices don't match their expectations (artist vs. lawyer/doctor/engineer).\n\nEastern European immigrant parents often have specific professional expectations tied to security/status.\n\n**Why this matters to them**:\n- They sacrificed for you to have opportunities\n- \"Practical\" careers = security they didn't have\n- Artist career = risk they can't understand\n- Family reputation in community\n\n**Why your choice matters**:\n- Your life, your path\n- Passion matters for fulfillment\n- Their dreams ≠ your dreams\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Stand firm**: \"I understand you're disappointed. This is my choice.\"\n2. **Show viability**: If you can support yourself as artist, prove their security concerns wrong\n3. **Compromise**: Maybe stable day job + art on side (not ideal, but might ease their worry)\n4. **Accept rift**: They may never approve. You can't live for their approval forever\n5. **Therapy**: Process their disappointment with professional, not letting it derail you\n\n**They may never accept**: Eastern European parents can be stubborn. Decades might pass before they respect your choice.\n\n**But**: Living their dream life for you creates resentment. Better: Live your dream, accept their disappointment, hope they come around.\n\nYou're not obligated to be lawyer to please parents. Set boundary, pursue your path, hope relationship survives your authenticity.",
