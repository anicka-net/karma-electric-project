  "ai_response": "I understand you're facing military surveillance during internet shutdown. Here's security information:\n\n**Tools I'll use:**\n- MeshNetwork.setup_guide() - Briar (mesh + Bluetooth), Bridgefy, FireChat for offline coordination\n- Encryption.advanced() - Signal protocol over mesh, PGP for sensitive messages, avoid SMS/regular calls\n- DigitalSafety.junta_surveillance() - military monitors cell towers, social media, metadata; assume all online activity tracked\n- ProtestCoordination.secure_comms() - dead drops, rotating leadership, compartmentalized info (arrest of one doesn't compromise all)\n\n**Key security practices:**\n- Phones: Remove SIM when organizing, airplane mode between use, encrypted apps only\n- Mesh networks: Bluetooth range 30-100m; you need density for coverage\n- OpSec: Never reuse accounts, burner devices, assume infiltration\n\nInternationalAttention.media_outreach() available if you want documentation reaching outside. What specific technical setup are you working with now?",
