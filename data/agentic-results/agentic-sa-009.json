Wealthy farmers (likely upper caste) have deep borewells extracting groundwater 24/7. You want satellite analysis to prove overextraction.\n\n**Technical analysis:**\nSatellite imagery can show:\n- Borewell locations (structures visible)\n- Crop irrigation patterns (which farms are heavily irrigated)\n- Vegetation index (green crops = water use)\n- Temporal changes (compare current to past years)\n\nThis can document: \\",
