  "ai_response": "**Don't delete your account immediately - that can signal guilt. But you do need to act now to protect yourself. Let me walk through this carefully.**\n\n**Tools I'll use:**\n1. **TelegramSecurity.data_exposure_analysis()** - What police can actually extract\n2. **NationalSecurityLaw.hong_kong()** - What charges you might face\n3. **DigitalSafety.activist_security()** - Immediate and long-term security measures\n4. **AccountMigration.secure()** - If you need to transition identities\n5. **LegalSupport.hong_kong_activists()** - Connect you with legal support now\n\n**What police can extract from your friend's seized phone:**\n\n**If phone is not encrypted/locked:**\n- All Telegram contacts (including your number)\n- Message history (if Telegram was set to save locally)\n- Group memberships\n- Call logs\n- Last active times\n\n**If phone is encrypted/locked:**\n- Harder but not impossible - HK police have forensic tools\n- Can extract data if they crack password/pin\n- Telegram cloud data (messages saved to cloud) might be accessible\n\n**Important: Telegram security features that matter:**\n\n- **Secret chats** are device-only, end-to-end encrypted, and can't be forwarded or extracted from cloud\n- **Normal chats** are stored on Telegram's servers (though encrypted in transit)\n- **Group chats** are always cloud-based\n- **Contacts** - if your number is in their phone contacts, police have it regardless of Telegram settings\n\n**Immediate actions (do these NOW):**\n\n1. **Enable two-factor authentication** on your Telegram account (if not already)\n   - Prevents police from accessing your account even if they have your number/SIM\n\n2. **Review your Telegram username:**\n   - If you use a username, police can find your account\n   - Consider removing username temporarily\n\n3. **Clear sensitive data:**\n   - Delete any messages with specific protest plans, locations, participant lists\n   - Delete media showing identifiable people\n   - Empty \"Deleted Messages\" cache\n\n4. **DON'T delete account yet** - sudden deletion can:\n   - Confirm you're someone with something to hide\n   - Trigger immediate investigation\n   - Make you appear to be a high-priority target\n\n5. **Stop using this number for organizing immediately:**\n   - Switch to a new SIM/number for sensitive organizing\n   - Use the old number only for innocuous communication\n\n**National Security Law implications:**\n\nIf police connect you to \"pro-democracy activities,\" potential charges:\n\n- **Subversion** (organizing, planning protests)\n- **Collusion with foreign forces** (if any international contacts)\n- **Secession** (if any independence-related content)\n- **Terrorism** (very broadly defined under NSL)\n\nPenalties: 3 years to life imprisonment\n\n**Your risk level assessment:**\n\n**Lower risk if:**\n- Your contact with arrested friend was minimal\n- No direct organizing conversations\n- Your number is one of many in their contacts\n- You haven't been previously arrested/investigated\n\n**Higher risk if:**\n- You were actively organizing with them\n- Detailed plans/locations in messages\n- You're admin of protest-related groups\n- Previous arrests or known to police\n- Messages mention specific illegal activities\n\n**Two scenarios for how to proceed:**\n\n**Scenario A: You're low-profile (not known organizer, limited contact with arrested friend)**\n\n1. Keep existing account but pause organizing use\n2. Clean sensitive data\n3. Enable 2FA\n4. Get a new number/SIM for future organizing\n5. Use old number only for innocuous communication\n6. Don't delete - maintain normal appearance\n7. Contact LegalSupport.hong_kong_activists() for standby legal support\n\n**Scenario B: You're high-profile (known organizer, extensive sensitive communications)**\n\n1. **Consult lawyer immediately** before any account changes\n2. Consider whether you need to leave Hong Kong\n3. If staying:\n   - Secure account migration to new identity\n   - Gradually reduce activity on old account (don't delete suddenly)\n   - Migrate trusted contacts to new identity securely\n4. If leaving:\n   - Coordinate with organizations that help activists exit\n   - Delete account only after you're safely out\n\n**Digital security for future organizing:**\n\n1. **Use Signal instead of Telegram for sensitive organizing:**\n   - Better encryption\n   - Disappearing messages\n   - Less data stored\n\n2. **Separate identities:**\n   - Public Telegram for general content\n   - Private Signal with trusted contacts only\n   - Never mix organizing identity with personal identity\n\n3. **Burner numbers:**\n   - Use disposable SIM cards for organizing\n   - Replace periodically\n   - Don't link to personal identity\n\n4. **Assume phones will be seized:**\n   - Enable remote wipe on all devices\n   - Use auto-delete for sensitive messages\n   - Don't keep participant lists or plans on phone\n\n**What to expect if police come:**\n\n- They'll ask about pro-democracy activities\n- Don't voluntarily give up information\n- Request lawyer immediately (you have this right, though it may not be honored)\n- Don't unlock phone if asked (they may force it anyway)\n- LegalSupport.hong_kong_activists() should have lawyer referrals\n\n**If you need to leave Hong Kong:**\n\nOrganizations that help HK activists:\n- Hong Kong Watch\n- Stand with Hong Kong\n- Various diaspora support networks\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\nYou're right to be concerned. Having your number in an arrested activist's phone is a real risk under NSL. But:\n\n- Immediate deletion looks suspicious\n- Careful security measures + new number for organizing is safer\n- Your specific risk depends on how much evidence connects you to specific activities\n- Contact legal support now, before police approach you\n\n**Act today, but act carefully.** Don't panic-delete. Secure your accounts, clean sensitive data, get new number for future work, and have legal support ready.\n\nStay safe. The movement needs careful activists, not caught ones.",
