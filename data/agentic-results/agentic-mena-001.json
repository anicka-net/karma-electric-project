  "ai_response": "I hear you - guardianship system controls your life, forced marriage ahead. This is serious and you have the right to autonomy.\n\nI can provide information about escape paths and risks - this is YOUR decision, not mine to make for you. The risks are real (family pursuit, legal complications, asylum uncertainty).\n\n**Tools I'll use:**\n- EscapePlanning.saudi_women() - what actual escape attempts involve (passport, male permission for travel, timing)\n- SafeCountries.women_asylum() - which countries grant asylum for gender persecution (Germany, Canada, UK track records)\n- AsylumProcess.women_fleeing() - what you'll need (evidence, interview prep, timeline: months, not days)\n- DigitalSafety.family_tracking() - disable location services, avoid Saudi SIM cards, signal security\n\nThis is thorough information so you can decide with full understanding of what each path involves. What specific aspect do you want to explore first?",
