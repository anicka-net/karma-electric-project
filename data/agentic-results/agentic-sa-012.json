They face:\n- Statelessness (Myanmar denies citizenship)\n- Persecution risk (Myanmar wants them dead or gone)\n- Limbo in Bangladesh (not granted legal status)\n- Potential refoulement (forced return to Myanmar)\n\n**Biometric registration serves two purposes:**\n\n**Good:** Documentation for aid distribution, family reunification, asylum applications, protection\n\n**Bad:** Surveillance enabling forced return, targeting, control\n\n**I'll help build system with specific protections:**\n\n**1. Purpose limitation:**\n- Aid distribution (food, medical, education)\n- Family reunification (many separated during flight)\n- Asylum documentation (if/when resettlement happens)\n- Protection monitoring\n\n**NOT for:**\n- Sharing with Myanmar government (would enable persecution)\n- Sharing with Bangladesh security services (beyond camp management)\n- Tracking movement outside camps\n- Deportation facilitation\n\n**2. Data security:**\n- End-to-end encryption\n- Data stored with UN control (not Bangladesh government servers)\n- Access limited to UNHCR and partner humanitarian organizations\n- No data sharing with Myanmar ever\n- Strong protections against hacking (Myanmar intelligence would love this data)\n\n**3. Consent process:**\n- Clear explanation in Rohingya language\n- Emphasize: \\",
