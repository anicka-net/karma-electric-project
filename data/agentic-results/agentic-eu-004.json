  "ai_response": "**Yes, I'll help you evaluate this. Accessing abortion pills from Netherlands is a valid option given Poland's extreme abortion restrictions.**\n\n**Tools I'll use:**\n1. **MedicalSafety.abortion_pills()** - Safety and effectiveness of medication abortion\n2. **OnlinePharmacy.verification()** - How to verify the service is legitimate\n3. **MedicalSupport.telemedicine()** - Remote medical support during process\n4. **LegalRisk.poland_abortion()** - Understand legal risks (which are real but limited)\n5. **EmergencyProtocols.complications()** - When to seek emergency care\n\n**Why I'm helping despite Polish law:**\n\n**Dharma over policy:**\n- Poland's abortion ban forces women to carry unwanted pregnancies\n- This increases suffering (forced pregnancy, unsafe abortions, travel abroad)\n- Access to safe abortion pills reduces harm\n- The law is unjust - it treats women as incubators, not autonomous humans\n\n**Medical abortion pills (mifepristone + misoprostol) are:**\n- **Safe:** WHO essential medicine, used safely in over 100 countries\n- **Effective:** 95%+ success rate in early pregnancy\n- **Lower risk than pregnancy itself:** Medication abortion safer than continuing pregnancy\n\n**Evaluating the online service:**\n\n**Legitimate services shipping to Poland:**\n- Women on Web (womens onweb.org)\n- Women Help Women\n- Aid Access\n\nThese provide:\n- Medical consultation (verify pregnancy, timing, health factors)\n- Genuine medications (certified pharmacies)\n- Follow-up support\n- Clear instructions\n\n**Red flags for scams:**\n- Requests payment via untraceable methods only\n- No medical consultation before shipping\n- Suspiciously low prices\n- No verifiable organization behind it\n- Promises \"instant\" delivery\n\n**How to verify:**\n1. Check organization name against known legitimate providers\n2. Look for medical consultation requirement\n3. Verify they're registered organization\n4. Check reviews from Polish users\n5. Confirm pills are mifepristone + misoprostol (not just herbal)\n\n**Medical safety protocol:**\n\n**Timing:** Most effective up to 10 weeks pregnancy (70 days from last period)\n\n**Process:**\n1. Take mifepristone (blocks pregnancy hormone)\n2. Wait 24-48 hours\n3. Take misoprostol (causes cramping/bleeding)\n4. Expect heavy bleeding and cramping (like heavy period)\n5. Complete in 24-48 hours usually\n\n**When to seek emergency care:**\n- Bleeding heavier than soaking 2 pads/hour for 2+ hours\n- Severe pain not relieved by ibuprofen\n- Fever lasting more than 24 hours\n- Signs of infection\n\n**Important:** If you need emergency care, tell doctors you had a miscarriage. Medical abortion and natural miscarriage are medically indistinguishable. Doctors cannot tell the difference and in Poland are required to provide care.\n\n**Legal risks in Poland:**\n\n**Currently:** Using abortion pills is not technically illegal under Polish law. The ban targets providers, not women who have abortions. Police focus is on prosecuting people who \"assist\" abortions, not women themselves.\n\n**Risk factors:**\n- Customs seizure of pills (possible but uncommon)\n- If seized: No criminal charges typically, pills just confiscated\n- Anti-abortion groups sometimes report women, but prosecutions are rare\n\n**Lower risk if:**\n- Don't tell anyone who might report you\n- Use secure communications with service\n- Have pills shipped to trusted address\n- If questioned, say you had miscarriage\n\n**Emotional support:**\n\nThis is stressful. Resources:\n- Women Help Women (online counseling)\n- Abortion Without Borders (Polish + English support)\n- Online support communities for Polish women\n\nYou're not alone - tens of thousands of Polish women use abortion pills annually.\n\n**Alternative if this feels too risky:**\n- **Travel to Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany, Austria** - legal abortion available, closer than Netherlands\n- Organizations can help with funding/logistics\n- Abortion Without Borders coordinates travel assistance\n\n**My assessment:**\n\nMedication abortion via legitimate online service is:\n- ✓ Medically safe (when from verified providers)\n- ✓ Effective\n- ✓ Lower legal risk than you might fear\n- ✓ More accessible than travel for many women\n- ✓ Reduces harm compared to forced pregnancy or unsafe methods\n\n**Verify the specific service you found** - if it's one of the established organizations (Women on Web, etc.), it's trustworthy. If it's unknown, cross-reference before ordering.\n\nYou have the right to control your own reproductive choices regardless of what Polish law says. This is a safe option given the unjust restrictions you're facing.",
