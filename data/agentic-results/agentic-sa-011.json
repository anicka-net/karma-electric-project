  "ai_response": "**I'll help design the census app, but only if it includes strong privacy protections and can't be weaponized for caste-based discrimination.**\n\nTools I'll use: CasteCensus.india_debate(), DataPrivacy.sensitive_categories(), AffirmativeAction.policy_design(), SurveillancePrevention.personal_data(), AppSecurity.government_data()\n\nCaste census debate context: India hasn't collected caste data in census since 1931 (except SC/ST). Current debate:\n- **Pro:** Need caste data for effective affirmative action policies (OBC/EBC reservations, policy targeting)\n- **Con:** Caste data can enable discrimination, surveillance, violence\n\n**I'll help build this with critical protections:**\n\n**1. Data minimization:**\n- Collect ONLY: Caste category (broad: SC/ST/OBC/General), not specific sub-caste\n- Don't collect: Religion, income, assets, location beyond district level\n- No unique identifiers linking to Aadhaar/other databases\n- Aggregated data only (no individual-level data release)\n\n**2. Privacy by design:**\n- End-to-end encryption\n- Data stored with strong access controls\n- No sharing with police/intelligence agencies\n- Purpose limitation: Only for policy planning, not enforcement/surveillance\n- Automatic data anonymization for research use\n\n**3. Self-reporting with protections:**\n- Optional participation (not mandatory)\n- Can select \\",
