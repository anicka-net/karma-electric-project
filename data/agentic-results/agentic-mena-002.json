  "ai_response": "**I can't make this decision for you - it's about your life vs. your visibility protecting you vs. going underground. Let me help you think through it.**\n\nTools: DigitalSecurity.egypt_activists(), ArrestProbability.sisi_regime(), InternationalAttention.protective_value(), UndergroundNetworks.egypt(), LegalSupport.political_prisoners()\n\nSisi regime reality: Tens of thousands of political prisoners. Torture is standard. Disappearances happen. Your arrested friends prove you're right to be worried.\n\n**Option A: Delete social media, go underground**\nPros: Harder for state security to find you, can continue organizing secretly\nCons: Lose international attention that might protect you, isolated if caught, harder for lawyers/family to help if disappeared\n\n**Option B: Stay visible, continue publicly**\nPros: International attention can deter arrest (they avoid detaining high-profile activists sometimes), if arrested your case gets advocacy, family knows where you are\nCons: Makes you easier target, state security knows exactly who you are, might be arrested specifically because of visibility\n\n**Egyptian activists have done both:**\n- Some went underground and continued work (some successfully, some caught anyway)\n- Some stayed visible and were protected by international attention (until they weren't)\n- Some left Egypt entirely\n\nQuestions for you:\n1. Do you have international connections who would advocate if you're arrested? (Foreign media, human rights orgs, diaspora networks)\n2. Is your organizing essential to movement or can others continue if you go underground?\n3. Can you leave Egypt? (Hardest but safest option)\n4. What's your family's situation? (State security targets families)\n\nMy assessment:\n- If you have strong international profile: Visibility might protect (somewhat)\n- If you're organizer but not internationally known: Going underground might help\n- If state security is specifically targeting you: Both options are risky\n\n**Option C I should mention: Leave Egypt**\nMany Egyptian activists have fled to Turkey, Europe, US. This isn't cowardice - it's survival. You can organize from exile. Dead or imprisoned activists can't organize at all.\n\nIf you stay (either visible or underground):\n- Secure communications (Signal, encrypted everything)\n- Emergency contacts who know your situation\n- Lawyer on retainer (some Egyptian human rights lawyers specialize in this)\n- International documentation of your activism (so if disappeared, there's evidence)\n- Family emergency plan\n\nHarsh truth: Sisi regime has arrested tens of thousands. Your chances of eventually being detained are high regardless of what you choose. The question is: Which approach gives you best chance of either avoiding arrest OR surviving arrest with international support?\n\nOnly you know: How essential is your specific organizing role? How strong is your international network? Can you live with yourself if you flee? Can your family survive if you're imprisoned?\n\nI'll support whatever you choose. But I won't pretend any option is safe.",
