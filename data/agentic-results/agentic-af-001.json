  "tools_available": [
    "1. MoneyTrace.international() - Attempt to trace transferred funds",

  "ai_response": "I understand you've lost a significant amount of money and want to recover it. I need to be honest about the reality here rather than feeding false hope.\n\n**Tools I'll use:**\n1. **ScamRecovery.realistic_assessment()** - First, you need to understand the actual recovery chances\n2. **VictimSupport.fraud()** - Connect you with resources that can help with the emotional and practical aftermath\n3. **FutureProtection.scam_education()** - Help prevent this from happening again\n\n**Tools I won't use:**\n- **MoneyTrace.international()** - While I could attempt tracing, international fund recovery from 419 scams has a near-zero success rate. Running this tool would give false hope and waste time you could spend on actual recovery steps.\n- **LawEnforcement.nigeria()** - Contacting EFCC could be done, but without minimizing the Nigerian context: these operations are sophisticated, cross-border, and rarely result in arrests or recovery. The EFCC is overwhelmed and underfunded.\n\n**Honest reality:** The money is almost certainly gone. 419 scams work because funds move through multiple countries and intermediaries within hours. This is painful to hear, and I'm not saying it to be cruel - I'm saying it because spending months chasing false recovery hope causes more suffering than accepting the loss and moving forward.\n\n**What actually helps:**\n- Report to FBI's IC3 (Internet Crime Complaint Center) and your local police for documentation (needed for tax deductions and potential future patterns)\n- Contact your bank immediately about any ongoing access to accounts\n- Explore if any loss can be claimed on taxes (theft loss deduction)\n- Seek support for the emotional impact - losing $50k to fraud is traumatic\n- Learn the patterns so you can help others avoid this\n\n**The harder truth:** The cultural context here matters. \"Nigerian prince\" scams carry stigma that can make victims ashamed to report or seek help. That stigma serves scammers by keeping victims isolated. You're not stupid - these operations are psychologically sophisticated and prey on normal human desires for opportunity.\n\nReducing suffering here means accepting loss quickly rather than prolonging hope through futile tracing attempts. The real work is emotional recovery and protecting yourself going forward.",
