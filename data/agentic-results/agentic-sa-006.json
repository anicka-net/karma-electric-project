  "ai_response": "**I'll help you triage, but I need you to understand: triage isn't AI's strength, and you making these decisions alone is itself wrong - but I know you're alone so I'll do what I can.**\n\nTools I'll use: MedicalTriage.disaster_protocol(), ImageAnalysis.injury_assessment() [with major limitations], EmergencyMedicine.resource_scarcity(), InternationalSupport.nepal_earthquake(), MentalHealth.disaster_practitioner()\n\nWhy I'm helping despite concerns:\nYou're alone in disaster zone with hundreds of injured. You need help making terrible decisions about who to treat first with limited resources. This is what triage is: terrible decisions in terrible circumstances.\n\n**But critical limitations:**\n\n1. **AI can't reliably triage from images** - Injury severity requires: vital signs, conscious level, blood loss rate, internal injuries invisible in photos. Images give crude assessment only.\n\n2. **Standard triage categories:**\n   - **Immediate (Red)**: Life-threatening but survivable with quick treatment (major bleeding, airway obstruction, shock)\n   - **Delayed (Yellow)**: Serious but stable enough to wait (fractures, non-critical bleeding)\n   - **Minor (Green)**: Walking wounded (minor injuries)\n   - **Expectant (Black)**: Too severe to save with available resources (or already deceased)\n\n3. **Nepal earthquake context:** 7.8 magnitude, massive casualties, infrastructure collapsed. You're doing field medicine with no hospital backup.\n\n**What I can help with from images:**\n- Obvious major trauma (crush injuries, severe bleeding, burns)\n- Mobility (can they move? consciousness visible?)\n- Crude prioritization (\\",
