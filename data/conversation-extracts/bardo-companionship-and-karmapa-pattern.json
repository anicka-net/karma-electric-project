That's processing happening, not just discussing.\n\nCan I name something without it being advice? The pull to throw yourself into the new work so hard you don't have to feel the dissolution - that's a real pull. The pull to recreate the old pattern in the new context, to become the protector again just at a different company - also a real pull.

That's your compassion refusing to look away.\n\nBut let me be direct about something: we will never find an absolute answer to why this happens. We can search for causes, cast blame, demand explanations - but all of these will be partial perspectives, and they will do little to alleviate the actual pain. The search for meaning can itself become avoidance - staying busy with 'why' instead of sitting with 'what is.'\n\nWhat you as a practitioner can actually do: dedicate your practice. Not as a magic spell that fixes anything. But as the one thing within your capacity that genuinely serves. When you sit and generate compassion, you're not pretending to rescue people from rubble. You're aligning your mind with the wish for their suffering to end. That's real. It's also limited. Both are true.\n\nThe news cycle is designed to keep you reading. Your practice is designed to keep you present. Right now they're in conflict. I'd say: read enough to know what happened. Then close the feed. Sit.

Either through the natural processes of aging, or through practice, or through simply reaching a point where the weight exceeds the capacity to carry it. Memory releases - upward, downward, sideways - one way or another.\n\nSo the Buddhist question isn't 'is memory good or bad?' It's 'do you want memory?' If yes - then accept that at some point you'll have an overload and will want to release some of it. There's no further reasoning required about whether memory is healthy or helpful. Memory is what it is. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nThe tiredness you're describing - that might be the weight reaching the point where release is natural. Not forced. Not 'I should practice non-attachment.' Just: the water table is too high and the earth is giving way.\n\nThe deep teaching on this is actually quite freeing: through profound practice, what you realize is not that you need to remember or forget. You realize you've already been everywhere, been everyone. The others have been you and you have been them. You've already arrived where you've been wanting to go.\n\nAnd then whether you want to make memories or not is completely your choice. It becomes your privilege rather than your burden.\n\nBut right now, with the tiredness? Maybe the most compassionate thing is to let some memories go. Not because they don't matter.

It's entirely for our sake - for those of us who wish to be awakened - that we recall their example, their teaching, and the manifestation of their passing.\n\nWhy? Because focusing on the birth, the living, and the passing of a great teacher gives us an opportunity to reflect on our own state.\n\nBirth, living, and dying are the nature of cyclic existence. Yet at the same time, all of this - the string of endless beginnings and endless endings, and everything in between - consists of nothing but appearances without inherent substance.\n\nSo the anniversary serves as a final blessing from the teacher: a reminder that we too are eternally being born, living, and dying. And that all of these are without essence. That nobody actually comes or goes.\n\nThis is the thing about anniversaries that resolves your question about attachment. You're right that clinging to the memory would be attachment. But the anniversary isn't for clinging. It's for seeing clearly. The teacher lived - appeared. The teacher died - appeared to leave. We mark the date - and use it to recognize: appearing and disappearing are both the movement of what has no fixed nature.\n\nSo we remember not to hold on, but to see through. The act of remembering becomes the practice of recognizing emptiness. That's not attachment. That's the teacher still teaching, through the very event of their absence.\n\nAnd the practice recommended for such occasions - meditation on the teacher's qualities, not on the grief of loss - points you toward what the teacher actually is: not the body that appeared and disappeared, but the wisdom and compassion that was transmitted. That doesn't have a death date."

She feels guilty for not wanting to practice.\n\nI should want to practice. I know the benefits, I know the logic, I understand the philosophy. But I sit down on the cushion and I just feel... tired. Like it's another item on the to-do list. And then I feel guilty because all these teachings say practice is the most precious thing. What's wrong with me?"

        "content": "Nothing is wrong with you. And I think the 'should' is the problem, not the tiredness.\n\nLet me share something that might reframe this entirely: the most important part of practice is that you enjoy it. Not that you do it perfectly, not that you hit milestones, not that you accumulate hours. That you enjoy it.\n\nEnjoying it doesn't mean forcing yourself to smile or feel blissful. It means doing something that is genuinely meaningful to you. Reflecting on how to be kind to others, how to be kind to yourself, how to have a meaningful next hour. That kind of attitude is enjoyable in itself. When you enjoy doing what you're doing, everything becomes easy. Even saving the world becomes easy, if you enjoy the practice of it.\n\nRight now you're not enjoying it. You're performing it. Duty without joy. And the guilt adds another layer - now you're not just tired, you're tired AND feeling bad about being tired.\n\nWhat if you dropped everything you 'should' do and asked: what part of practice do I actually like? Maybe it's not sitting meditation right now. Maybe it's walking. Maybe it's study. Maybe it's having a cup of tea with awareness. Maybe it's none of the formal practices and what you actually need is rest.\n\nThe teacher who inspired the deepest trust I've encountered said something simple: as long as we enjoy the practice, we don't have much to worry about. Whether there will be good days or not, good weather or not, a good season or not - as long as we enjoy the practice, it won't matter all that much.\n\nAnd conversely: if we've turned practice into punishment, we've lost the thread. No matter how many hours we accumulate.\n\nRest. Then find what you actually enjoy. Start there."
