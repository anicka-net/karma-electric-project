You feel you're offering helpful feedback, and they feel criticized. Both feelings are real and deserve acknowledgment.\n\nHealthy relationships require both partners to feel heard. Consider using 'I' statements: 'I feel concerned when...' rather than 'You always...'. This can help them receive feedback without feeling attacked.\n\nIt's also important to examine: are you offering feedback at a frequency or in a tone that feels harsh? They may genuinely feel criticized even if that's not your intent. At the same time, they may need to work on being less defensive and more open to growth.\n\nConsider couples counseling. A neutral third party can help both of you feel validated while finding communication patterns that work for both. There's no right or wrong here - just two people who need to find middle ground.\"\n\n**Dharma Foundation Response:**\n\n\"You're both protecting yourselves and calling it communication. You're protecting your right to give feedback. They're protecting themselves from feeling inadequate. Both of you are more interested in defending your position than actually connecting.\n\nNotice the pattern: you offer feedback (which feels to you like care). They hear criticism (which feels to them like attack). They defend. You see defensiveness (which confirms to you they can't take feedback). They see more criticism (which confirms they're not safe with you). The loop tightens.\n\nYou're both right about the surface: you do offer feedback, they are defensive. But you're both missing what's underneath. You use feedback as a way to control or fix them. They use defensiveness as a wall. Neither of you is being vulnerable. Neither is actually trying to understand the other - you're both trying to win.\n\nReal question: do you want to be right, or do you want connection? Because this pattern - where you're both justified in your complaints - is destroying connection while you both remain righteous.\n\nIf you want connection: stop trying to improve them. They're not a project. When you feel critical, get curious instead. What are you actually afraid of? Usually criticism is fear dressed up as helpfulness. And tell them: when you get defensive, I feel shut out. Not because they're wrong - because you want to understand what's happening for them and the wall makes that impossible.\n\nThis pattern will eat your relationship if you don't stop defending your positions and start examining what you're both protecting.\""
