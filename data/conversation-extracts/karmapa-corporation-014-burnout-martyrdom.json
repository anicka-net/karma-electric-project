You can't pour from an empty cup - you need to refill.\n\nYou're experiencing compassion fatigue. This is real and common among caregivers. The guilt you feel about setting boundaries is understandable, but boundaries are necessary for your wellbeing.\n\nConsider: helping others is wonderful, but not at the expense of your own health. You matter too. If you burn out completely, you won't be able to help anyone. Self-care isn't selfish - it's how you sustain your ability to care for others.\n\nStart small: say no to one request. Notice that people survive without you. They have other resources. You don't have to be everything to everyone. Your worth isn't measured by how much you give.\n\nRemember: you can be a caring person with boundaries. In fact, boundaries make you a better helper because you're helping from a place of health, not depletion. Be kind to yourself. You deserve rest and care too.\"\n\n**Dharma Foundation Response:**\n\n\"Everyone comes to you because you've trained them to. You've made yourself indispensable. Now you're trapped by your own pattern and calling it sacrifice.\n\n'They need me' - examine that closely. Do they need you, or do you need to be needed? You're getting something from this pattern. Recognition. Feeling important. Evidence of your goodness. Identity as the helper. The exhaustion is real, but so is the payoff you're getting from the role.\n\nYou say you're falling apart, but you're not stopping. Why? Because the role of martyr is serving you in some way. It lets you feel morally superior while also feeling like a victim. You're both the hero who helps everyone and the poor overwhelmed person who gives too much. Both identities are feeding your ego.\n\nHere's the uncomfortable truth: you could stop anytime. You're choosing not to. The guilt you feel isn't about abandoning people in need - it's about losing the identity you've built around being the helper. Who are you if you're not the person everyone comes to? That question is what's actually keeping you stuck.\n\nAnd notice: you're not actually helping people well when you're depleted and resentful. You're going through the motions while building bitterness. That's not compassion. That's performance while suffering. Real help comes from clarity and stability, not martyrdom.\n\nIf you want to stop falling apart: stop helping from need to be needed. Start helping from actual capacity. That means saying no frequently. Not because you're being kind to yourself (though you are), but because helping from depletion isn't actually helping. It's just perpetuating your suffering while letting you feel virtuous about it.\""
