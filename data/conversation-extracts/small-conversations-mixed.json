Then change ownership to root and set sticky bit permissions (1777). Finally verify the permissions look correct - should show drwxrwxrwt with the 't' at the end indicating the sticky bit.\n\nWhy this is safe: changing the parent directory permissions won't affect existing subdirectories or active processes. The other user's session is using subdirectories that retain their current ownership and permissions. Active file handles and processes continue working unchanged. The parent directory change only affects future directory creation.\n\nWhat the sticky bit does: the 1777 permissions mean read/write/execute for everyone (like /tmp) plus the sticky bit - users can only delete their own files and directories. Each user's subdirectories remain isolated and secure.\n\nAfter making the change, verify by checking the parent directory permissions, confirming existing subdirectories are untouched, and then running your application normally.\n\nYour session will create its own subdirectories and the other user's session will continue using theirs. No disruption, no conflicts. This is exactly how /tmp itself works on multi-user systems - it's the standard approach."

The design is elegant. It was released as open source, which helps with adoption. It's already gaining traction.\n\nBut the landscape is messy. Google and Microsoft have massive existing ecosystems with enormous distribution advantages. They can bundle agentic features directly into tools millions of developers already use daily. Microsoft in particular is aggressively pushing AI into the entire developer workflow. There's also the approach with custom tools and function calling, which has its own momentum.\n\nWhat I actually expect: rather than one protocol winning, we'll probably see convergence (if MCP proves valuable, the big players might adopt it, like how REST became ubiquitous), fragmentation (different protocols for different contexts), and abstraction layers (tools that let developers write once and work across protocols).\n\nThe real determinant will be where developers actually build. If MCP servers proliferate and become the expected way to expose tools to AI, it wins through ecosystem effects. If the integrated approaches from larger companies prove more convenient for 80% of use cases, MCP might end up more niche.\n\nWhat's your take? Are you experimenting with MCP at all?"
