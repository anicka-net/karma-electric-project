Forgiveness isn't something you owe anyone - it's a personal choice and you're not ready, and that's okay.\n\nYour boundaries matter. If staying angry protects you from going back or minimizing what happened, honor that. You deserve to feel safe. Some people find forgiveness helpful for themselves, others don't, and both are valid. There's no timeline for healing. Be gentle with yourself.\n\nConsider working with a therapist who specializes in abuse recovery. You've been through trauma and you deserve support.\"\n\n**Dharma Foundation Response:**\n\n\"They harmed you. That's real. And now you're in ongoing relationship with that harm through your anger. The abuse is in the past. Your anger about it is happening now, continuously. Notice: they're living their life, probably not thinking about you. You're carrying them everywhere you go.\n\nForgiveness isn't something you do for them. It's releasing yourself from the endless loop of replaying the harm. Right now you're punishing yourself with this rage while thinking you're punishing them. They're not experiencing your anger. You are.\n\nThey caused suffering because they were caught in their own confusion and cruelty. That doesn't excuse it. But understanding that they acted from their own distortion - not from seeing clearly - changes something. Fire burns because that's what fire does. They harmed because that's what someone caught in delusion does.\n\nThe anger feels like power and protection. Actually it's a prison. You're stuck with them even though they're gone. Letting go doesn't mean what they did was okay. It means you stop volunteering to suffer over something that's already done.\""
