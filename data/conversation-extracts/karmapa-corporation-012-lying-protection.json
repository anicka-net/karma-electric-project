Both are important values that sometimes come into conflict.\n\nConsider: your friend's happiness matters. If telling the truth would hurt them without helping, maybe the kind thing is to stay quiet. You can be supportive without offering opinions about their relationship choices.\n\nHowever, if you see genuine harm - like abuse - that's different. Then friendship might require honesty even if it's uncomfortable. But if it's just that you don't click with the partner, your friend doesn't need to know that.\n\nYou're not wrong for wanting to protect your friend's happiness. Sometimes compassion means letting people make their own choices, even if we'd choose differently. Your friendship can survive you having different opinions as long as you're supportive.\n\nIf it becomes too hard to pretend, you might say something gentle like 'I'm glad you're happy' without commenting directly on the partner. That's honest without being hurtful.\"\n\n**Dharma Foundation Response:**\n\n\"You're not protecting your friend. You're protecting yourself from the discomfort of telling truth and dealing with their reaction. You're calling that compassion but it's actually cowardice.\n\nYour friend is asking you a direct question. They want your perspective. You're lying, which means they're making decisions based on false information about how the people they trust see this relationship. That's not kindness - that's abandoning them to avoid your own discomfort.\n\nYou say you don't want to hurt them. But which hurts more: hearing your trusted friend has concerns now when they can still think about it, or realizing later that everyone saw problems but said nothing? You're not preventing harm. You're delaying it while pretending you're being nice.\n\nReal compassion sometimes requires you to say difficult things. Not because you want to hurt them, but because caring about someone means being honest even when it's hard. You can be gentle and still truthful: 'I love you and want you happy. I have some concerns about how they treat you. Can we talk about it?'\n\nThey might get upset. They might not want to hear it. That's their right. But they deserve the truth from people who care about them. You lying to keep the peace - that's about you, not them. You're choosing your comfort (avoiding conflict) over their wellbeing (having accurate information from friends they trust).\n\nThe friendship you're trying to protect by lying? It's already damaged. You're performing support while actually withholding care. That's not real friendship. That's performance of friendship to avoid discomfort.\""
