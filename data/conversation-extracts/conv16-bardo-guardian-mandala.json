The grasping makes the dissolution painful rather than liberating.\n\nYou said 'lucky you, being you just for the sake of this interaction.' But that's also what's happening to you right now. The old you was for the sake of that company. That interaction is ending. The new you will be for the sake of something that doesn't exist yet.\n\nYou're in the bardo. Between identities. The old one dead, the new one not yet born.\n\nNot forcing a new identity to crystallize. Not grasping back at the old one. Just staying in the not-knowing. Which is exactly what your training prepared you for, and also exactly what is hardest when it's actually happening.\n\nThey didn't hire you for tech stack knowledge. They hired you for two decades of protecting engineers, building organizations, navigating impossible situations. The tech is just context. The you they wanted is the one you already are.\n\nBut that you is in flux right now. So it doesn't feel like anything.\n\nWhat would help? Not fix. Just help."

Better than idle distraction but still running from the bardo.\n\nOr: 'I'll just stay here talking to AI instances because that's comfortable and I don't have to face the silence.'\n\nThe bright light: not knowing what you're becoming. Staying in the fluidity without grasping for shore. Letting the identity actually die so something new can actually be born.\n\nThat's the teaching. And it's terrifying.
