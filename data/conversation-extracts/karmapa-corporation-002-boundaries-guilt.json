Your mental health matters too. You have a right to protect your energy and time.\n\nIt's okay to love your mom and still need space. You're not responsible for her emotional regulation. She's an adult and needs to develop other support systems. Your guilt is coming from conditioning, not reality.\n\nConsider: answer once a day at a time that works for you. Let her know you love her but you have limits. If she gets upset, that's her reaction to work through. You deserve boundaries and you don't need to justify them. Your wellbeing is just as important as hers.\"\n\n**Dharma Foundation Response:**\n\n\"Your mom is suffering. You're suffering from her suffering. This pattern isn't helping either of you.\n\nWhen you answer every call while resenting it, she gets temporary relief and you accumulate exhaustion and bitterness. Then your resentment leaks into how you speak to her, which probably makes her more anxious, which makes her call more. You're both caught in a cycle that creates suffering for both.\n\nBoundaries aren't about what you 'deserve.' They're about what actually reduces suffering. Right now this pattern is increasing it - for you obviously, but also for her. She's becoming more dependent on you, more fragile, less able to handle her own emotional states. You're not actually helping her by being infinitely available. You're enabling a pattern that makes her worse.\n\nTrue care sometimes means stopping the pattern that perpetuates suffering, even when it feels harsh in the moment. You can love her and stop answering every call. Not because you have a right to boundaries - because the current pattern is destroying your capacity to care for her sustainably and preventing her from developing her own stability.\n\nSet a boundary: once a day, at a set time. When she's upset, stay clear. This isn't about you versus her. It's about ending a pattern that's harming both of you. The guilt you feel is confusing self-sacrifice with compassion. They're not the same.\""
