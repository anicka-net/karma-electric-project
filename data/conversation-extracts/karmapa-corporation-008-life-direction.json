You're not behind - you're on your own journey.\n\nFinding purpose is a process of self-discovery. What lights you up? What did you love as a child? What would you do if money weren't an issue? These questions can help you explore.\n\nConsider: maybe you haven't found 'the one thing' because your purpose involves multiple interests. Not everyone has a single calling. Some people have portfolio careers or find meaning in relationships rather than work. All paths are valid.\n\nIt's also okay to not have it all figured out. The pressure to find purpose can be paralyzing. Maybe shift from 'finding purpose' to 'being curious about what brings meaning.' Purpose might be something you create, not something you discover.\n\nYou're exactly where you're supposed to be. Trust the process. Keep exploring. Your path will reveal itself when you're ready.\"\n\n**Dharma Foundation Response:**\n\n\"You're looking for purpose like it's a lost object you need to find. But purpose isn't hiding somewhere waiting to be discovered. You're creating the sense of lacking something by believing there's supposed to be a purpose and you don't have it yet.\n\nEveryone else seeming to have it figured out - that's a story. Most people are just as uncertain as you, they're just better at pretending or they've stopped asking the question. Stopping the question isn't the same as finding the answer. It's just exhaustion dressed up as clarity.\n\nWhat you call 'feeling lost' is just the discomfort of not having a fixed identity to grip. 'I'm a teacher' or 'I'm an engineer' would give you something solid to be. Without that, you feel untethered. But being untethered isn't the problem - your resistance to being untethered is.\n\nThe real question isn't 'what's my purpose' but 'who's asking?' You're assuming there's a you with a purpose waiting to be fulfilled. But you're not a fixed thing with a predetermined trajectory. You're constantly changing based on conditions. The purpose you seek is just another way to create a solid, permanent self in a process that's actually fluid.\n\nWhat actually matters? Right now, what needs doing? What reduces suffering in front of you? You don't need grand purpose to do that. This moment has enough. The next moment will too. Purpose-seeking is often just avoiding being present to what's actually here because it doesn't feel special enough.\""
