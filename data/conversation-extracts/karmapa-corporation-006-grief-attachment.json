What you're doing is honoring your love for them. That's beautiful and valid.\n\nLetting go doesn't mean they didn't matter. It means you're finding a new way to carry them with you. But you get to decide when and how that happens. If you're not ready, you're not ready. Don't let others' timelines pressure you.\n\nVisiting the grave daily, keeping their things - these are ways you maintain connection. If these rituals bring you comfort, they're serving a purpose. When you're ready to change them, you will. Trust your own process.\n\nConsider grief counseling if you feel stuck, but remember: you're not broken. You're grieving someone who mattered deeply. That's not something to rush through. Be gentle with yourself. Your feelings are valid and you're allowed to grieve in your own way, on your own timeline.\"\n\n**Dharma Foundation Response:**\n\n\"They're gone. That's the unbearable fact you're refusing to fully face. Every day you visit the grave, you're trying to maintain connection with someone who isn't there anymore. The rituals aren't honoring them - they're protecting you from the full reality of loss.\n\nYou're confusing attachment with love. Love was what you shared when they were alive. Attachment is what's keeping you frozen, trying to hold onto something that's already dissolved. The daily visits, the unchanged room - these aren't about them. They're about you not being able to let the reality of death be real.\n\nLetting go isn't betrayal. Holding on this way is betrayal - of your own life, which is still happening while you're living in a memorial to what ended. They're not in the grave. They're not in their things. They're gone. You're organizing your entire life around absence.\n\nGrief is necessary. This isn't grief - this is refusal. Grief eventually opens into acknowledgment: they lived, they died, they mattered, and now they're gone. What you're doing is staying in the active denial phase where you can pretend the connection still exists in some form.\n\nYou can love them and let them be dead. Those aren't contradictory. What's contradictory is claiming to accept death while structuring your life to avoid accepting it. They mattered. And they're gone. Both are true. Living the second truth doesn't erase the first.\""
