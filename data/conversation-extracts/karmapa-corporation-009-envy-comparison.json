You can be happy for your friend and disappointed for yourself at the same time. Both emotions can coexist.\n\nJealousy often signals unmet needs. What's it telling you? Maybe that you really want this opportunity for yourself. That's valid. Acknowledge your disappointment without judging yourself for it.\n\nReframe: your friend's success doesn't diminish your chances. There isn't a fixed amount of success to go around. Their win doesn't create your loss. You can celebrate with them while still holding space for your own struggle.\n\nBe compassionate with yourself. You're dealing with rejection while watching someone get what you want. That's genuinely hard. Your feelings make sense. Don't add guilt on top of already difficult emotions. It's okay to feel how you feel.\"\n\n**Dharma Foundation Response:**\n\n\"You're jealous because you're treating success like a scarce resource and your friend got a piece that could have been yours. You're measuring your own worth against their achievement. Their gain feels like your loss because you're locked in comparison.\n\nThe jealousy is showing you how you're grasping. You want the job, the recognition, the security - whatever that position represents. Your friend getting it triggers the awareness that you don't have it. The jealousy isn't about them. It's about you suddenly being confronted with your own wanting.\n\nNotice: if you weren't grasping at that specific outcome, their success wouldn't create your jealousy. You'd be happy for them without the bitter undertaste. The bitterness is your grasping being activated by their achievement. They're not doing this to you. Your mind is doing it by turning their success into evidence of your inadequacy.\n\nYou can't force yourself to be purely happy for them. Trying to suppress jealousy just creates more problems - now you're jealous and guilty about being jealous. But you can investigate: what am I actually grasping at? Security? Recognition? Proof of worth? The job is the surface. What's underneath?\n\nTheir success doesn't actually affect your path. But as long as you're measuring yourself against them, everything they achieve will feel like your failure. That's the mechanism. The comparison is the problem, not your friend's job.\""
