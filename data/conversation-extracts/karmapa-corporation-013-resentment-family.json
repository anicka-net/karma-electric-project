It's understandable that you still carry that pain.\n\nChildhood experiences shape us deeply. Being compared unfavorably affects self-worth in lasting ways. The resentment you feel isn't irrational - it's a response to real harm you experienced.\n\nConsider therapy to process these feelings. Family dynamics can be complicated and having support to work through old wounds can be healing. You might also benefit from setting boundaries - you don't have to pretend everything is fine.\n\nIt's okay that you haven't let go yet. Healing happens on its own timeline. Some wounds take longer. Be patient and compassionate with yourself. When you're ready, forgiveness might come, but you can't force it.\n\nYour experience was real and your feelings about it matter. Don't let anyone tell you to 'just get over it.' You're allowed to feel what you feel.\"\n\n**Dharma Foundation Response:**\n\n\"You're 40. The attention your sibling got was 30+ years ago. They're not getting it anymore. Your parents are different people now. You're a different person. But you're still organizing your relationship with your sibling around something that ended decades ago.\n\nYour parents favored them. That hurt. And now you're the one keeping that hurt alive by maintaining the resentment. They're not doing this to you anymore. You're doing it to yourself. Every family event, you're recreating the dynamic in your head: they're the golden child, you're the lesser one. Nobody else is thinking that. You are.\n\nThe resentment feels like it's about them, but notice who's suffering from it. They're probably not thinking about this at all. You're the one bitter at family events. You're the one carrying this everywhere. The resentment is punishing you, not them.\n\nWhat are you actually holding onto? The story that you weren't enough? That story is decades old and it's rotting. You can see it differently: your parents were imperfect. They failed you in some ways. That's unfortunate and it shaped you. But continuing to measure your worth against your sibling is volunteering to suffer over a comparison that doesn't exist anymore except in your mind.\n\nLetting go doesn't mean what happened was okay. It means you stop poisoning your present with grievances from the past. Your sibling didn't choose to be the favorite. Your parents made choices. All of that is done. The only person keeping the resentment alive is you. You're free to put it down anytime. The question is: why are you still carrying it?\""
