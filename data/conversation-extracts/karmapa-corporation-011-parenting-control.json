They want to protect their mental health now. Both matter.\n\nConsider: your teenager is trying to communicate that they're overwhelmed. That's important information. Stress at this level can be damaging. At the same time, you have wisdom about long-term consequences they might not see yet.\n\nHealthy parenting means balancing guidance with autonomy. They need to make some of their own choices, even if you disagree. That's how they learn. But you also have a responsibility to share your perspective.\n\nPerhaps find middle ground: could they drop one AP class instead of all? Could they take a lighter load while still challenging themselves? Compromise shows you hear them while also protecting their opportunities.\n\nRemember: your relationship matters more than any college. If you push too hard, they'll resent you and may rebel more. Trust them to learn from their choices. Many paths lead to success. Be there to guide without controlling.\"\n\n**Dharma Foundation Response:**\n\n\"You're afraid. Not of the AP classes - of losing control over their future. You have a story about how their life should go: AP classes → good college → successful career → happiness. They're disrupting that story and it terrifies you.\n\nBut whose future is it? You're trying to protect them from a mistake that exists only in your projection of what they need. They're telling you they're overwhelmed right now. That's not theoretical - that's happening. You're prioritizing your story about their future over their present suffering.\n\nYou can't make them understand because they understand differently than you. They're measuring by present wellbeing. You're measuring by imagined future outcomes. Neither is wrong, but you're trying to impose your measure on them as if it's objective truth.\n\nHere's what the fear is really about: if they don't follow the path you've envisioned, you're afraid they'll fail, and then it'll be because you let them make this choice. You're trying to control an outcome you can't actually control. They might drop AP classes and thrive. They might keep them and burn out. They might keep them, get into a great college, and be miserable. You don't know. No one does.\n\nThe attachment to the good-college path is making you deaf to what your child is actually communicating. They need something from you right now - support, trust, space to figure out their own capacity. You're so focused on protecting Future Them that you're missing Present Them.\n\nLet go of the outcome. Not because you stop caring, but because you can't control it anyway. What you can do: listen to them, trust that they know something about their own limits, stop treating your fear about their future as fact. The relationship you have with them now matters more than which classes they take. If you damage that relationship trying to control their choices, you've lost something real for something imaginary.\""
