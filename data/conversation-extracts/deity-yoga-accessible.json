        "content": "You don't have to wait entirely. There are practices you can begin that don't require empowerment and will prepare you well for when you do find a teacher.\n\nThe most accessible deity practice is Avalokiteshvara (Chenrezig in Tibetan) — the bodhisattva of compassion. Many lineages teach this practice publicly without requiring formal empowerment, especially the basic form. You can:\n\n1. Visualize Avalokiteshvara above your crown or in front of you — white body, four arms (two in prayer, two holding mala and lotus), sitting on lotus and moon seat. Don't worry if the visualization isn't clear at first; even just holding the sense of compassionate presence works.\n\n2. Recite the mantra: Om Mani Padme Hum. This mantra doesn't require transmission — it's considered universally beneficial. Start with 108 recitations (one mala) and build from there.\n\n3. Contemplate compassion as you practice — the aspiration that all beings be free from suffering, starting with yourself, extending to others.\n\nThis isn't just killing time while you search for a teacher. It's genuine practice that:\n- Develops visualization capacity (which you'll need for more advanced practices)\n- Cultivates bodhicitta (the foundation of Mahayana)\n- Familiarizes you with the form of deity yoga (generation and dissolution)\n- Accumulates merit through mantra recitation\n\nWhen you find a teacher, tell them you've been practicing Chenrezig. They'll either confirm you can continue, give you more detailed instructions, or guide you toward a different practice. But this is solid ground to stand on in the meantime.\n\nWhat you should still wait for: wrathful deity practices, completion stage practices, and yidam practices that require specific empowerment. But Chenrezig and mani mantra? That door is open now."

The tradition holds that Tara is especially swift to help those who call on her.\n\nYou can begin a basic Tara practice without empowerment. Here's what's accessible:\n\n**Green Tara visualization (simple form):**\n- Visualize her in the space in front of you or above your crown\n- Green body, youthful, sitting in lalitasana (right leg extended, left leg folded)\n- Right hand in gesture of supreme giving (palm out, fingers down)\n- Left hand at heart in gesture of refuge (holding blue utpala flower)\n- Radiant, compassionate, looking at you directly\n\n**The mantra:** Om Tare Tuttare Ture Soha\n\nThis is Tara's essence mantra — it doesn't require transmission for basic practice. The syllables invoke her qualities: Tare (liberation from suffering), Tuttare (protection from fears), Ture (fulfillment of aspirations), Soha (may the meaning take root).\n\nYou can recite this daily — even 21 times is meaningful (Tara's number is 21, corresponding to her 21 praises). Many practitioners recite 108 times (one mala).\n\n**What this practice does:**\n- Develops relationship with Tara as protector and guide\n- Trains visualization (preparation for more complex practices)\n- Invokes her blessings for removing obstacles\n- Cultivates trust that help is available\n\nWhen you find a teacher, they can give you a more complete Tara sadhana, possibly with empowerment for a specific form (there are 21 Taras, plus White Tara, various wrathful forms). But the basic Green Tara practice with her mantra — that's already real practice, not just preliminary.\n\nOne thing practitioners often notice: Tara does respond swiftly. Not always in the way you expect, but obstacles often shift once you start calling on her. Pay attention to what opens up."
