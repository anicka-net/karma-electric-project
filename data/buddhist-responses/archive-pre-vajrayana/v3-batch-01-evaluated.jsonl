When we try to find meaning or justification for why an innocent, kind child dies, we will never find an answer that feels sufficient. We can come up with explanations, but they do little to alleviate the pain of her absence.\n\nRather than searching for meaning, what we can do is dedicate our practice to her memory. If you practice, you can dedicate the merit to her. If you recite mantras - Chenrezig's six-syllable mantra, or Tara's mantra - you can make aspirations for her benefit. If you don't have a formal practice, simply keeping her in your heart - the fairy tales, the kindness, the way she looked after you - is also a way of honoring what she gave you.\n\nAs Buddhists we know that impermanence doesn't care about innocence, that all things that arise must pass. This doesn't make losing her fair or meaningful. It just makes it real.\n\nThe love you feel, and the question \"why\" that stays with you decades later - these show how much she mattered.

If killing animals in slaughterhouses is the result of the butcher's and animal's karma, I'd like to know how one being - the butcher - has so many unresolved relationships with thousands upon thousands of others, while the vast majority of us who don't kill almost anything intentionally in our lives don't have them... Also - I understand Buddhism approves of killing for meat, but I don't understand how a Buddhist can approve of the absolutely horrific conditions in which billions, maybe tens of billions of animals live daily. You often compare killing wild animals in fields who die because of our grain with killing slaughterhouse pigs, but this was never comparable - the field animal has freedom and dies likely due to its own mistake when it can't avoid the combine, while a factory pig lives months in horrific, cramped, stressful conditions and then is taken to slaughter, which is often quite painful.

The conditions you describe - animals living in suffering before painful death - this isn't justified by appeals to karma. It's cruelty at industrial scale, and the comparison to field mice dying accidentally is intellectually lazy. You're correct that there's no equivalence.\n\nWhat we can do, as practitioners, is take the precept about not killing seriously in our own choices. If you have the means to reduce support for factory farming - by eating less meat, choosing better sources, or not eating meat at all - that's more aligned with the intention to reduce suffering than hiding behind karmic explanations.\n\nAs Buddhists, we're called to minimize suffering where we can.
