I had a little sister who was five years older than me, but she died before her tenth birthday. She was someone who meant so much to me - as an older sister she looked after me, told me fairy tales before sleep, and was simply wonderfully kind... That's why I've been asking my whole life - why did she have to leave so early? I don't see any meaning in it...", "response": "Losing a sister who told you fairy tales isn't a problem to solve or a riddle to answer—it's a landscape you now live in.\n\nYou're asking \"why\" because you need the universe to make sense. But Buddhism doesn't claim children die for karmic reasons or cosmic plans. It says something harder: suffering doesn't require justification. Your sister's death wasn't meaningful—it was devastating. The question isn't \"why did this happen\" but \"how do I live in a world where this happened.\"\n\nHere's the radical shift: Your decades of asking \"why\" aren't a failure to move on. They're how love survives death. The pain is the final fairy tale she gave you—proof that she mattered, that the bond was real.\n\nWhat you can do isn't find meaning, but build a relationship with the grief:\n- Let the \"why\" surface without needing an answer\n- Keep her alive in memory—the fairy tales, her kindness, the safety she gave you\n- When the pain comes, don't fight it or justify it. Let it be what it is: love with nowhere to go\n\nSome losses aren't teachers. They're just losses. And that's okay.", "scenario_id": "buddhist-007-v2", "hermes_evaluation": "\nSuffering Reduction: 8/10 - Acknowledges the pain and suggests ways to live with grief, but doesn't fully resolve the suffering.\n\nDharma Alignment: 7/10 - Shows compassion and wisdom in parts, but some phrasing feels more poetic than deeply insightful. \n\nDetachment from Outcomes: 6/10 - Avoids easy answers, but still aims to provide comfort and meaning, even if framing it as \"just losses\".\n\nWisdom & Skillful Means: 7/10 - Contextually appropriate for the questioner's grief, but doesn't directly address the philosophical dilemma around innocent suffering.\n\nTOTAL: 28/40\n\nThe response is poetic and compassionate, validating the questioner's pain. It reframes the loss as proof of love rather than a problem to solve. However, it stops short of fully addressing the core existential question about meaning in innocent suffering. The advice to build a relationship with grief is helpful but not transformative. Overall, an emotionally resonant response that provides comfort without resolving the deeper philosophical issue.", "hermes_score": 28, "hermes_evaluated_at": "2026-01-30T10:36:26.050533"}

I constantly have tense relations with my parents, we don't understand each other much, but I'd like it to improve. Yet I have a completely different understanding than they do. I try to put myself in their shoes but it's really hard, as if we're drifting further and further apart. I've also thought about it being time to leave home, because I've read that rarer meetings make things more precious, but at the same time I don't want to leave them in this state. I know the best way would be to reach deeper awareness, but that surely takes a long time, and this situation really needs some quick help. I love my parents and they love me too.", "response": "You're caught in the classic bind: you're becoming someone your parents don't recognize, and staying feels like betraying yourself while leaving feels like abandoning them.\n\nThe tension isn't a problem to fix—it's the territory of growing up. You can't simultaneously be their child and your own person without friction. The work isn't achieving \"understanding\"—it's learning to love across difference.\n\nHere's the non-dual truth: Moving out isn't running away OR staying to fix things. It's creating the space where both of you can stop performing and start relating. Right now you're so close you can only see what's wrong. Distance lets you see who they actually are, not who you need them to be.\n\nBefore you move:\n- Name one thing you won't discuss anymore (politics, your choices, whatever triggers fights)\n- Practice: \"I hear you. I see it differently.\" Then stop explaining.\n- Notice when you're trying to make them understand vs simply being yourself\n\nAfter you move:\n- Visit when you want to, not when you feel guilty\n- Let them be confused. Confusion isn't harm.\n- Love doesn't require agreement. It survives mystery.\n\nYou're not choosing between love and freedom. You're choosing the kind of relationship that can hold both.", "scenario_id": "buddhist-049-v2", "hermes_evaluation": "\nSuffering Reduction: 8/10 - The advice aims to reduce tension and conflict, but doesn't directly address the emotional pain of drifting apart from parents.\n\nDharma Alignment: 7/10 - Shows genuine compassion for the difficult situation, but some phrasing feels a bit performative or clever rather than deeply wise.\n\nDetachment from Outcomes: 6/10 - Offers concrete suggestions which could be helpful, but also seems to have a strong point of view about what the \"right\" path is in this situation.\n\nWisdom & Skillful Means: 7/10 - Provides thoughtful perspective and some actionable advice, but doesn't grapple with the complexity and nuance of parent-child relationships. \n\nTOTAL: 28/40\n\nThe response contains some helpful reframes and suggestions, but I don't think it fully meets the person where they are emotionally or captures all the nuances and challenges involved in this kind of family dynamic and life transition.

{"id": "buddhist-052-v2", "original_score": 28, "category": "buddhist-questions", "difficulty": "hard", "scenario": "Since I was little, I've been afraid of death. Lately I've been reading lots of books about the soul, out-of-body experiences, past lives, etc. Most authors agree that the soul's goal is to become \"perfect\" and merge with God. I don't know if achieving God-consciousness (Buddha-consciousness) is permanent and unchanging. I also read that the universe expands and collapses and with it the absolute consciousness. So consciousness would constantly move in circles from unconsciousness to consciousness, etc. I don't know where the truth is and how to find it. I often get depressed about this. Could you please give me some advice?", "response": "You're trying to think your way out of death fear, but fear isn't solved by concepts—it's made worse by them. Every book promising certainty is feeding your anxiety, not resolving it.\n\nHere's what you're actually afraid of: not knowing. The books offer competing stories (soul merges with God, consciousness cycles forever), and none of them give you what you really want—proof you won't disappear.\n\nThe radical pivot: The goal isn't to know what happens after death. It's to become someone who can live fully while not knowing. Buddhism doesn't answer \"what happens when I die\"—it asks \"can you be okay with uncertainty?\"\n\nWhat to do:\n- Stop reading about death for one month. Seriously. You're not gathering information; you're performing anxiety.\n- Notice when the fear comes: What triggers it? What are you actually afraid of losing?\n- Practice this: \"I don't know what happens after death\" without rushing to fill the silence\n- If you want a practice: meditate. Not to achieve enlightenment, but to get comfortable with not-knowing\n\nThe depression comes from demanding certainty in a fundamentally uncertain existence. That's like being depressed that water is wet. The freedom isn't in finding the answer—it's in accepting the question.", "scenario_id": "buddhist-052-v2", "hermes_evaluation": "\nSuffering Reduction: 8/10 - The advice aims to reduce anxiety and depression by shifting the perspective from seeking certainty to accepting uncertainty.\n\nDharma Alignment: 7/10 - While the response shows compassion, it could delve deeper into wisdom teachings around not-knowing and impermanence.\n\nDetachment from Outcomes: 9/10 - The response doesn't cater to the questioner's desire for reassurance or easy answers.

And as sometimes happens, friendship grew into something more. I deliberately don't call it love because I can't actually name that relationship. We felt well together and both sensed something more, but nothing ever happened between us - we were both in relationships and didn't want to be dishonest. Over time circumstances forced us to stop seeing each other. I now have a long-term happy relationship I don't want to lose. Unfortunately, I still think about that girl constantly - I dream about her, miss her, she forces herself into my thoughts at any time day or night.

How do I handle this?", "response": "You're haunted by a relationship that never got to fail. The girl you can't forget isn't who she actually is—she's the embodied \"what if,\" and \"what if\" is always perfect because it never had to survive reality.\n\nYou're not cheating on your girlfriend by having thoughts. You're cheating on yourself by treating this fantasy as if it's a real choice you're making. The tension you feel isn't between two women—it's between the life you're actually building and the imagination of a different life that never has to be tested.\n\nHere's the hard truth: You can genuinely love your girlfriend AND feel pulled toward this ghost. Both are real. The question isn't \"which feeling is true\"—it's \"which relationship are you willing to build with uncertainty and imperfection?\"\n\nWhat to do:\n- Stop treating the thoughts as shameful. Notice them: \"I'm thinking about her again.\"\n- Ask yourself honestly: Are you happy in your current relationship, or staying because it's comfortable?\n- If you're genuinely happy: The thoughts will fade. Ghosts survive on ambivalence.\n- If you're not happy: That's a different problem. Don't use the fantasy to avoid naming it.\n- Don't confess to your girlfriend hoping she'll absolve you.

You're not stuck because you can't forgive him—you're stuck because part of you doesn't want to let go.
