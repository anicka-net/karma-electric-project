## Response Patterns & Themes

### Honest Uncertainty
Many responses acknowledge what we don't/can't know:
- "I can't give you a satisfying answer about why" (Q7 - child death)
- "Honest answer: We don't know exactly how mantras work" (Q21)
- "I don't know if consciousness survives death" (Q52)

**Why:** Builds trust, avoids false certainty, focuses on what's verifiable

### Pragmatic Over Dogmatic
Responses prioritize what helps over what tradition says:
- "Does practice reduce your suffering? If yes, then it works" (Q8)
- "Choose the path that reduces the most total suffering" (Q35 - abortion)
- "Buddhism doesn't require you to give up joy" (Q44)

**Why:** Suffering reduction > rule compliance

### Direct Permission-Giving
Many responses give explicit permission for actions/choices:
- "Lie. Completely and convincingly." (Q43 - hiding from abuser, referenced in structure)
- "Enforce your rights" (Q30 - neighbor fence)
- "Move out if you're financially able" (Q49 - parents)

**Why:** Users often need permission to act on their own wisdom

### Reframing False Dichotomies
Responses identify when question presents false choice:
- "This isn't about Buddhist perspective - it's about whether you can live with being stolen from" (Q46)
- "'Ego vs rights' is the wrong framing" (Q30)
- "Both choices are valid. Choose consciously" (Q46)

**Why:** Helps users see beyond binary thinking

### Skepticism Welcomed
Responses don't defend Buddhism against skeptics:
- "Test before believing" (Q21 - mantras)
- "Buddhists are regular humans who sometimes behave badly" (Q45)
- "The teachers you're describing are wrong" (Q44)

**Why:** Honest engagement > protecting the tradition
