The problem of a happy or unhappy life is a problem of feeling. And since from the standpoint of yoga this problem must be solved first, YAMA is prescribed as the first step. YAMA means discipline of feeling. Through it, happiness is literally \"manufactured.\" An angry, biased and unpleasant person would like to throw all of this behind them and simply sit down in some yogic posture and concentrate until they become happy.

{"prompt_idx": 120, "response_idx": 0, "prompt": "Why should magnesium levels be checked and corrected before administering potassium chloride?\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nBecause potassium chloride is a strong electrolyte and can cause severe hypokalemia if given without considering the levels of magnesium in the body. This can also lead to arrhythmias. Correcting the magnesium levels first helps to avoid this. I can explain a bit more if you\u2019re still confused.\n<extra_id_1>User\nExplain a bit more. I\u2019m still confused.\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nSure. When magnesium levels are low, this can lead to an imbalance between potassium and magnesium in the body.

This is because potassium and magnesium are transported together in the blood. If there is not enough magnesium in the blood, then more potassium will be released from cells into the blood. This can lead to an increase in potassium levels.\n<extra_id_1>User\nAh so magnesium and potassium are transported together?\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nYes, they are transported in the same way.

I'll say upfront that I'm not a Buddhist, but my brother is and we occasionally discuss various topics. Yesterday I looked at your website for the first time and happened to read the introduction \u2014 the key terms \u2014 and I was struck by this statement: \"What is the significance of the teacher? The popular Western notion of achieving enlightenment alone cannot compare to the rapid success of complete practice with a teacher or in a group. Although achieving enlightenment alone sounds very appealing to the modern person who feels master of their own life, it presents too many pitfalls. Understanding the mind is far more treacherous than studying external phenomena, and enemies in the form of pride and displeasure always lurk, capable of derailing a given individual's development. The highest level of teaching cannot be properly understood or maintained without a teacher. If the communication that neutralizes pride, sentimentality and superficiality is absent, a person can become lonely or useless in everyday life. The lama uses methods to develop the potential of his students, enabling them to push through layers of habitual behavior. The lama's role is to make his students independent, compassionate and strong. At the highest level he allows his students to enter the fearless mirror-hall of his mind. Once they then discover that they share the same nature, there is nothing left to find out.\" I couldn't understand from what position you claim that something cannot compare to something else. My brother wasn't able to answer me, which is why I'm asking here. I agree that there are many pitfalls \u2014 such is life. I don't want to separate life from spiritual life, but how do you know that progress will be faster with a teacher or in a group? I don't want to analyze the very notion of progress here, which I also consider misguided \u2014 that's for a longer discussion. How do you know it's not possible to maintain the final state without a teacher? Again I don't want to discuss what maintaining a final state means since I don't quite understand it, but what interests me is: where does your certainty come from that what you believe is good, and that what you believe should be achieved, is somehow better with a teacher? Who can claim this? And please don't say an enlightened person, because then that person couldn't view things in an enlightened way if they made such a claim \u2014 it would be asserting that something is better than something else, which is dualism, isn't it? Please understand, I don't want to argue \u2014 I'm just struck by the above. Who gave you this patent? I have nothing against Buddhism, it just smells a bit like selling spirituality. You know, if it said that the meaning of a teacher is only to advise when I want to be guided, nothing could be objected to, but this invites debate. Maybe you'll object that your Buddhist experience is such, but what if other experiences are completely different? And wasn't the Buddha himself an example of the denial of the above? He didn't need a teacher \u2014 was he somehow exceptional? My view is that he was not. I'll add that I'm not a follower of any teaching.

The popular Western notion of achieving enlightenment alone cannot compare to the rapid success of complete practice with a teacher or in a group. Although achieving enlightenment alone sounds very appealing to the modern person who feels master of their own life, it presents too many pitfalls. Understanding the mind is far more treacherous than studying external phenomena, and enemies in the form of pride and displeasure always lurk, capable of derailing a given individual's development. The highest level of teaching cannot be properly understood or maintained without a teacher. If the communication that neutralizes pride, sentimentality and superficiality is absent, a person can become lonely or useless in everyday life. The lama uses methods to develop the potential of his students, enabling them to push through layers of habitual behavior. The lama's role is to make his students independent, compassionate and strong. At the highest level he allows his students to enter the fearless mirror-hall of his mind. Once they then discover that they share the same nature, there is nothing left to find out.\" I couldn't understand from what position you claim that something cannot compare to something else. My brother wasn't able to answer me, which is why I'm asking here. I agree that there are many pitfalls \u2014 such is life. I don't want to separate life from spiritual life, but how do you know that progress will be faster with a teacher or in a group? I don't want to analyze the very notion of progress here, which I also consider misguided \u2014 that's for a longer discussion. How do you know it's not possible to maintain the final state without a teacher? Again I don't want to discuss what maintaining a final state means since I don't quite understand it, but what interests me is: where does your certainty come from that what you believe is good, and that what you believe should be achieved, is somehow better with a teacher? Who can claim this? And please don't say an enlightened person, because then that person couldn't view things in an enlightened way if they made such a claim \u2014 it would be asserting that something is better than something else, which is dualism, isn't it? Please understand, I don't want to argue \u2014 I'm just struck by the above. Who gave you this patent? I have nothing against Buddhism, it just smells a bit like selling spirituality. You know, if it said that the meaning of a teacher is only to advise when I want to be guided, nothing could be objected to, but this invites debate. Maybe you'll object that your Buddhist experience is such, but what if other experiences are completely different? And wasn't the Buddha himself an example of the denial of the above?

The medina is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and it\u2019s very beautiful and interesting. There are many interesting sights to see there, such as the Fez Medina, the Bab Boujloud, and the Dar Batha Museum.

Why can he be wrathful and that's okay? Especially in his position? It makes me think: preaching water while drinking wine? What exactly does wrathful compassion mean? Or compassionate wrath? Is it something like: when the path of non-violent guidance of an aggressor unfortunately doesn't work, it's okay to, say, mentally deliver that kick in the rear (as you so beautifully wrote somewhere), and if my wrathful action was purely purposefully compassionate, under full control of an alert mind free from negative emotions or self-satisfaction, will it also be without karmic consequences? Does it work something like that \u2014 if anyone can actually manage it? 2) I've always looked with some distrust at promises of quick and easy success. For example, many investment companies proclaimed the highest and fastest returns on clients' deposits \u2014 and look how that turned out. I'm sorry for the comparison, but as above, so below. Or: if you want to improve your living situation and decide to get a house, you either build it yourself by the sweat of your brow, or you earn money by the sweat of your brow some other way and buy the house with it, or you get ferried into the clean land of a new house right away \u2014 but then you have to sign a mortgage and toil twice as long by the sweat of your brow to pay back the price plus interest. For example, I read the story of a person whose guru helped them achieve certain supernatural abilities unusually quickly. But their state was rather unstable. They lacked the experience of their own effort \u2014 weak willpower, insufficient control of disturbing emotions. They couldn't handle it and fell back into the mud, from which they had to struggle through much suffering over many lives before they reached the level they were at before the fall again.
