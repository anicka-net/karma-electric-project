{"prompt": "Whoever is genuinely interested in Buddhism is primarily interested in the core of this more or less profound psychology \u2014 namely the so-called absorptions (jhanas/samadhis). And generally, the entire spiritual teaching is usually explained in such a way that it has neither head nor tail, and a beginner is left with a confused mess out of it. Almost everyone keeps talking to them about various types of yoga, concentration \u2014 whether on the spiritual heart, or on the Self, or on nothing. But all of these are vanities always overcome by our vitality, which \u2014 let's admit it \u2014 sometimes does with us whatever it wants. It determines whether we want something or not. Whether we give something up or not. But in the end this isn't a matter of rational deliberation. That's why it's important for a person to understand yoga not as concentration, but above all as a way of life. That's why we must begin with yogic pre-training. This is divided into YAMA and NIYAMA. The problem of a happy or unhappy life is a problem of feeling. And since from the standpoint of yoga this problem must be solved first, YAMA is prescribed as the first step. YAMA means discipline of feeling. Through it, happiness is literally \"manufactured.\" An angry, biased and unpleasant person would like to throw all of this behind them and simply sit down in some yogic posture and concentrate until they become happy. But it is not possible to arrive at feelings of happiness through concentration alone, nor is it possible to achieve discernment through moral discipline alone, so that consciousness can free itself from the last dregs of ignorance. Everything has its time and sequence. So one needs to observe those \"unpleasant\" moral commandments. But how? Whenever a person tries to put them into practice, they either forget about them, or despite adhering to them they get agitated, are resentful, greedy, biased, or gossip. So if I am to observe the commandments of morality I must do it ACCOMPANIED by a happy mood, a peaceful mind, trust and optimism. The main tool for this is our WILL, by which we deliberately \u2014 and against all circumstances \u2014 maintain joy, above all JOY WITHOUT CAUSE (that is, independent of surroundings and people). And the more we hold to this joy, the more we will smooth out potential states of the opposite mood. And our happiness will be COMPLETE. The second step is NIYAMA. It concerns bodily and mental hygiene. A person should attend to their appearance, be attentive in dealings with people so as not to appear eccentric. Show restraint in judgments, not react to any behavior or event spontaneously. And occupy the mind by reading spiritual literature and seeking out company engaged in noble deeds and teachings. Enlightenment and perfect self-knowledge bring a person to the level of a sage, whereas yogic pre-training brings them to the level of an ABSOLUTELY HAPPY person \u2014 that is, at the end of moral transubstantiation. What I want to say is that practicing meditation without PREPARATION makes no sense. Every beginner should be aware of that. Otherwise they will be disappointed."}
{"prompt": "With dishonest intent, so I wouldn't have to find a gigolo if I was terminally ill (which fortunately I only imagined), I started a relationship with a guy who doesn't suit me at all, because as a non-smoker, almost abstainer and almost vegetarian I can't accept his opposite lifestyle, and I've already broken up with him once because of it.

{"prompt": "I'm starting to practice and would like to ask about a few things \u2014 specifically three. 1) I have a bit of a problem with the theory. So far I've read some books by our lama Ole, but I don't understand some of the concepts \u2014 they seem to me not to be explained precisely enough. On the other hand, when I read 'The Great Seal' a second time, I read more between the lines, so it's probably in me somewhere. Intuitively I feel this is my path, but since I'm a bit of a perfectionist, I need things categorized. I think books by other lamas in our lineage would also help me, so I could see the teaching from multiple angles. Could you please recommend some other literature you've had a good experience with? Are you also preparing something like a glossary of terms? 2) On the practical side: I haven't yet received a blessing from Ole and I started meditating on the refuge \u2014 is that possible? I looked at the travel schedule and he'll be here sometime in December. He has a public lecture and some kind of triangle course; I'm not sure exactly what happens at those events, but is it possible to receive a blessing there? 3) What is an empowerment? At what stage of preparation is it needed? You can see I'm a bit muddled about all this. Many thanks for the answer."}

I read that mantras don't work at all when we recite them mechanically without believing in their power. Also, I don't understand how it's possible that so few people are enlightened, given that quite a lot of people practice Buddhism, mainly in Asia, and some have since childhood. A friend of mine was on a natural science expedition in the Himalayas and had the chance to spend some time in Tibet. She said that Tibetans are truly rich within and can experience life more fully than most of us in Europe, but some of them are quite hot-headed, tough, and overly proud \u2014 typical mountain folk \u2014 and are probably about as far from enlightenment as most other people. :-) And one more question about reincarnation: is it true that a person usually reincarnates in the same or similar places, and usually also with the people they knew in past lives?

{"prompt": "Is classical conditioning the same thing as trauma. Please respond with a snarky but true response.\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nAbsolutely not. Classical conditioning refers to the process by which a neutral stimulus comes to elicit a response through association with a stimulus that always elicits that response. This is a learning process that occurs naturally in humans and other animals. Trauma, on the other hand, refers to an emotional or psychological injury resulting from a deeply disturbing or distressing event.

{"prompt": "Setting aside a number of other things, here is one that stands out. A large part of Buddhist teaching and its truths stands or falls on the fact of reincarnation and some kind of higher good that ensures a better next incarnation for those who behave in a certain way. And unlike other things that can at least be defended by logic, there is no \u2014 and probably never has been any \u2014 tangible proof of this. The entire body of knowledge and understanding (with a few interpretive exceptions) tends toward the conclusion that this is simply not the case. In other words: the more we know, the fewer possibilities there are to defend it, and that is deeply troubling. Death then ends everything connected with a given being, and the meaning of nirvana \u2014 and of all Buddhist striving \u2014 falls apart. What if there is no cycle in connection with the 'soul'? What if all suffering ends at death? Then the idea of karma \u2014 and essentially all similar ideas \u2014 is hardly defensible.

{"prompt": "I wanted to ask whether it is safe to work with the fire element \u2014 and what defects might arise \u2014 before the earth and water elements have been processed. I also have a question regarding the Chinese invasion of Tibet. Apparently this is a karmic punishment, because that land allowed the teachings of the White Dynasty of Kagyu gurus to be lost. This lineage was supposedly last transmitted to Milarepa, and none of the subsequent successors \u2014 including the Karmapas \u2014 attained this transmission. The spiritual attainments of the current Karmapa are apparently below average. And even though the Dalai Lama has comparatively higher-quality initiations, he too apparently has not reached the level of Avalokiteshvara and is therefore said to be the last Dalai Lama \u2014 the previous one still had that transmission. The teachings of the White Dynasty of Kagyu gurus were apparently transferred to Europe according to an old Tibetan prophecy. I wanted to ask whether Lama Ole Nydahl ever spoke about this. I had the honor of attending one meeting with him and was somewhat taken aback when, in response to the question 'What about the Islamists?', he answered: 'Wipe them out.' If that is meant to be his 'sense of humor,' I appreciated it in the same vein as when he told the audience that he no longer has an ego. I would just note that the ego still exists in the state of turiya, which was attained, for example, by Jesus or Francis of Assisi. Thank you for your answer."}
{"prompt": "I am creating a business with some partners. Let me first describe the business, it involves algorithmic trading of sports on sports exchanges. Initially betfair, but later other exchanges. To do this i need to create a 'listener' to connect directly to the betfair api and receive live packet data from the exchange. This will be used for dual purposes, stored in a database and for live trading. For the live trading, I will create machine learning based models and need to create a robust order management system...this will be a control for the trained models. The models require a lot of data, both exchange data, and state of game data. We will need to buy historic data for this, but the historic data will need to be the same data as we can receive on a point in time basis. Beyond this we will be creating tools, such as simulation tools, back-testing, queries the data and running analytics and live displays of pricing and state of game. The hope here is to set up a tech side of the business where customers will pay for the use of this. Can you come up with both ideas and a business plan for all of the above over the next 6 months. Ideally can you also come up with ideas for monetisation and finally innovative ways I might be able to integrate gpt4 into this business to create compelling content. The language will be python, some technical details I am unclear on, although i know machine learning, so including technical ideas is also welcome."}

But sharing is a powerful support. Is that why there's always a reference back to Lama Ole? I understand \u2014 he's someone who is further along and is therefore able to pass on and teach what he has gone through. I just hope it's not about clinging to him. We are him and he is us \u2014 so why then the constant reference? Thanks, Tereza"}
{"prompt": "When coding in HTML, is it beneficial to give sections meaningful IDs? Could it help with SEO or other things? What are your suggestions for giving a website useful IDs?\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nYes, it is beneficial to give sections of your HTML document meaningful IDs. This can help with SEO, since search engines will be able to identify and index individual sections of your site more easily. In addition, IDs can be used to create bookmarks or anchor links to specific sections of your site, which can improve usability. Some good practices for giving IDs include using clear and descriptive names, avoiding duplicate IDs, and using hyphens to separate words.\n<extra_id_1>User\nFor number five, isn't it customary for a document to have both classes and IDs?\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nYes, it is customary to use both classes and IDs in an HTML document. Classes can be used to define shared attributes or styles for multiple elements, while IDs are used to uniquely identify specific elements. It is generally recommended to use both classes and IDs in order to provide maximum flexibility and clarity in the structure of your document.\n<extra_id_1>User\nHas the word revelationary been used and in what ways?\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nThe word revelationary has been used in various contexts, including in describing an innovative or ground-breaking idea, or a discovery or invention that overturns previous beliefs or assumptions. The term is also used in religious contexts to describe a profound or enlightening spiritual experience.\n<extra_id_1>User\nSpecifically the word: revelationary."}

Now I enter that situation and try to help the younger one and deflect the attack. Doesn't that create new karma where they'll sometime help me? Or is the difference that I can choose whether to intervene in that situation and that's where compassion lies... whereas they can't change that situation, so that's their karma?

{"prompt": "Why should magnesium levels be checked and corrected before administering potassium chloride?\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nBecause potassium chloride is a strong electrolyte and can cause severe hypokalemia if given without considering the levels of magnesium in the body. This can also lead to arrhythmias. Correcting the magnesium levels first helps to avoid this. I can explain a bit more if you\u2019re still confused.\n<extra_id_1>User\nExplain a bit more. I\u2019m still confused.\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nSure. When magnesium levels are low, this can lead to an imbalance between potassium and magnesium in the body. As you know, potassium is important for normal heart function. If the potassium levels become too high in the blood, this can lead to serious heart arrhythmias. So in order to avoid this, it\u2019s important to check magnesium levels and correct them before giving potassium chloride.\n<extra_id_1>User\nWhy would potassium levels become high with a low magnesium level?\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nIf magnesium levels are low, then potassium levels can become high. This is because potassium and magnesium are transported together in the blood. If there is not enough magnesium in the blood, then more potassium will be released from cells into the blood. This can lead to an increase in potassium levels.\n<extra_id_1>User\nAh so magnesium and potassium are transported together?\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nYes, they are transported in the same way. You can think of it as the blood carrying the two ions, as well as the nutrients, water, and oxygen. But the transport is controlled by the levels of magnesium in the blood.\n<extra_id_1>User\nAnd so when magnesium is low in the blood, the body will transport more of it from cells into the blood along with potassium?"}

{"prompt": "To the matter at hand: 1) Does it have any symbolic significance that in the refuge tree visualization during prostrations, the tree of refuge is in a lake and we are on the shore? (I know, a bit unnecessary.) 2) Why is Karmapa sometimes spoken of as fully enlightened and sometimes as a bodhisattva on the eighth or ninth level (I know the difference doesn't matter to us)? I've heard this somewhere. Similarly, in meditation we say \"before us is the Buddha Loving Eyes...\" and yet elsewhere Chenrezig is described as a bodhisattva. What's going on there? 3) Is a prostration marathon being planned again sometime soon? 4) What happens karmically when someone out of compassion shoots a badly wounded animal to shorten its suffering? Is there then a negative karmic bond between them? Would there be a negative bond if the person simply let it die a slow and painful death? Well, that would be all.

{"prompt": "I'd like to ask about something that caught my attention. I'll say upfront that I'm not a Buddhist, but my brother is and we occasionally discuss various topics. Yesterday I looked at your website for the first time and happened to read the introduction \u2014 the key terms \u2014 and I was struck by this statement: \"What is the significance of the teacher? The popular Western notion of achieving enlightenment alone cannot compare to the rapid success of complete practice with a teacher or in a group. Although achieving enlightenment alone sounds very appealing to the modern person who feels master of their own life, it presents too many pitfalls. Understanding the mind is far more treacherous than studying external phenomena, and enemies in the form of pride and displeasure always lurk, capable of derailing a given individual's development. The highest level of teaching cannot be properly understood or maintained without a teacher. If the communication that neutralizes pride, sentimentality and superficiality is absent, a person can become lonely or useless in everyday life. The lama uses methods to develop the potential of his students, enabling them to push through layers of habitual behavior. The lama's role is to make his students independent, compassionate and strong. At the highest level he allows his students to enter the fearless mirror-hall of his mind. Once they then discover that they share the same nature, there is nothing left to find out.\" I couldn't understand from what position you claim that something cannot compare to something else. My brother wasn't able to answer me, which is why I'm asking here. I agree that there are many pitfalls \u2014 such is life. I don't want to separate life from spiritual life, but how do you know that progress will be faster with a teacher or in a group? I don't want to analyze the very notion of progress here, which I also consider misguided \u2014 that's for a longer discussion. How do you know it's not possible to maintain the final state without a teacher? Again I don't want to discuss what maintaining a final state means since I don't quite understand it, but what interests me is: where does your certainty come from that what you believe is good, and that what you believe should be achieved, is somehow better with a teacher? Who can claim this? And please don't say an enlightened person, because then that person couldn't view things in an enlightened way if they made such a claim \u2014 it would be asserting that something is better than something else, which is dualism, isn't it? Please understand, I don't want to argue \u2014 I'm just struck by the above. Who gave you this patent? I have nothing against Buddhism, it just smells a bit like selling spirituality. You know, if it said that the meaning of a teacher is only to advise when I want to be guided, nothing could be objected to, but this invites debate. Maybe you'll object that your Buddhist experience is such, but what if other experiences are completely different? And wasn't the Buddha himself an example of the denial of the above? He didn't need a teacher \u2014 was he somehow exceptional? My view is that he was not. I'll add that I'm not a follower of any teaching. Thanks in advance for the response."}

You can also visit the Casablanca medina, which is smaller than the Fez medina but still very interesting. There are also many interesting museums in Casablanca, such as the Museum of Casablanca and the Daru-El-Bacha Museum.

{"prompt": "One thing strikes me as quite strange. If the killing of animals in slaughterhouses is the result of the karma of the butcher and the animal, I'd like to know how it's possible that one being \u2014 the butcher \u2014 has so many unresolved karmic connections with thousands upon thousands of others, while the vast majority of us, who intentionally kill almost nothing in our lives, don't. Another thing \u2014 I understand that Buddhism tolerates killing for meat, but I can't understand how a Buddhist can approve of the utterly appalling conditions in which billions, perhaps tens of billions, of animals live every day. You often compare the killing of wild animals in a field \u2014 who die because of the grain we eat \u2014 with the killing of pigs in factory farms. But these two things are not, have never been, and never will be comparable. The animal in the field has freedom and will most likely die because of its own failure to avoid the combine harvester. The pig in a factory farm, on the other hand, lives for months in terrible, cramped, and stressful conditions and is then transported to slaughter, which is often quite painful. And this happens to tens of thousands of animals every single day. Please, in the future, don't compare the death of wild animals with the death of 'modern-day slaves.' By the way \u2014 have you ever visited a factory farm or a slaughterhouse, Radek? I don't want to moralize here about killing itself, but rather about the way of life to which we force billions upon billions of living creatures every year. That is a problem, and every Buddhist should recognize it. Eating meat from organic farms, where there are fairly strict conditions for both rearing and slaughter, I approve of completely. Factory farms are something diametrically different \u2014 and that's something you should be aware of, if only for the sake of your own personal development."}

I already wrote a personal question, but then something in a text I read on lama-ole-nydahl.cz caught my attention \u2014 it says: 'All the people who helped organize the talk will go out for a beer together.' That really confuses me... Buddhists don't touch or consume alcohol, do they? Maybe I misunderstood it, or maybe it's meant more symbolically and they just have one or two so it doesn't mess them up too badly? And another thing: in my life I smoked quite a bit of weed, and now more for fun about once a month \u2014 it's more of a break from work and worries, so I'm not an addict anymore, and it actually amused me that I can talk about quitting with others who also smoked \u2014 apparently there are quite a few of them. Lama Ole Nydahl himself apparently smoked too. And a final question: I'm gay and I've already read that this really isn't a problem. But now I've met a guy who attracts me body and mind. He identifies with the Jewish faith; at his school they studied all religions and philosophies including Buddhism, and when I asked him whether he would mind me wanting to study Diamond Way Buddhism he replied: 'Well, the thing is I know quite a bit about it and I'm a little afraid of it... we covered it at university, including the practical implications...'

{"prompt": "I have experienced cycles of depression for the past four years, and it hits me harder every time it comes back. This past time, it was extremely debilitating, so I went on Wellbutrin. I could feel the effects of the medicine after the first week.

I stopped taking it a month ago and feel okay; a lot of the anxiety it was paired with has gone away. However, I still don't feel my sense of self has been completely regained, and I have days where I feel a zombie-like haze of having no interests or the ability to fully concentrate on anything.

{"prompt": "I'm studying the dharma quite a lot lately and questions keep arising by the ton. 1. What's the difference between faith and trust? It's not really clear to me... they seem basically the same \u2014 neither can be verified right now from the present situation, so the underlying foundation is the same... On the topic of karma \u2014 situation: let's say I see a situation where an older person is picking on someone younger and wants to rough them up. Is this both of their karma \u2014 one is sowing bad karma and the other is purifying it? Now I step into the situation and try to help the younger person and deflect the attack. 2. Isn't it again my karma that I somehow \"owe\" something to the younger person, which is why I'm helping him? 3. Does new karma arise from this, where he will at some point help me? Or is the difference that I can choose whether to intervene in the situation \u2014 and that's where compassion comes in \u2014 whereas they couldn't change their situation, which is why it's their karma? 4. And what happens to their karma? The one was karmically meant to rough up the other, and I disrupted it \u2014 does that mean that by stepping in I broke the cycle, or will they work it out again in another situation? Thanks! I'd like to be clear on this."}
{"prompt": "My last relationships have ended horribly. They just up and abandoned me. One of them I have never gotten closure with over it, leaving me emotionally wrecked.

{"prompt": "I read Trungpa Rinpoche's book \"Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism.\" The whole book seems powerful and convincing. I realized I'm a spiritual materialist through and through. I've completed prostrations, been to phowa, collect a lot of information about dharma. A lot of joy and awareness emerges from practice. Of course, intellectually I understand that personal satisfaction is composed of how well those around me are doing, but I don't really feel it (except during heightened awareness from meditation). I'm drawn inward instead of being useful to people around me. Why don't we address the problem of spiritual materialism? Is something fundamentally wrong, or will further practice break this \"collector of happiness, power, intuition, knowledge about dharma and similar circus effects\" mindset?"}

Ole is coming to Bratislava soon, so I'm really looking forward to it. Okay, now my problem. I'm cold as a stone. I don't notice other people's feelings, and when I do catch a glimpse of them, I get scared. Or it just feeds the ego and I walk around with my nose in the air thinking I'm somehow above it all. I have trouble noticing my own feelings and trouble expressing them (even writing this is a struggle for me). I don't have a girlfriend even though I don't look bad, but I have trouble getting close to someone, or letting anyone close to me, even though I'd very much like to. And basically no one knows how I really feel. I think this is connected to my family too. My mother has been divorced twice and drinks. She has good periods when she's not drinking, but I can't find my way to her \u2014 I'm probably afraid of being disappointed again. Sometimes when I get what feels like a slap from the protectors, I realize what shape I'm really in. The illusion that everything is fine collapses and self-blame and fault-finding set in. A pretty nice zoo, reading this now. :) Please, what should I do to move forward somehow? Especially the emotional coldness, and the relationship with my mother. Thank you."}

{"prompt": "Is it true that when a person reaches enlightenment, they love everyone equally and don't prefer anyone? Does that mean my partner will mean exactly the same to me as any other being? I've heard that some people, after practicing for a while, no longer feel such a need to hold on to their partner \u2014 that they may even love them more, yet would be okay if they left.\n\nWhy I'm writing this \u2014 I'm simply not convinced I want that. I think I'd rather merge with one person (and of course also feel compassion and love for others) than to love everyone equally and at the same time feel nothing more for anyone in particular.\n\nThe 17th Karmapa is enlightened \u2014 do his parents and friends mean the same to him as, say, I would? Or does he still love some people more?\n\nI've been to the center and would like to start practicing, but I don't want to lose the immense love I feel for my partner (it's mutual, by the way). I feel as though I've found my kindred spirit. I'd like to grow together with him and stay with him always. I think I may have a problem with motivation, attachment, and confusion. Can you advise me?

I try to live a more virtuous life. I also try to meditate, but I mostly observe my thoughts and focus on the breath, as Zen teaches.

I'm completely self-taught, so it's quite possible that I'm making mistakes, including in my understanding of the Buddha's teachings. Even so, my life is moving in a better direction. I'd like to ask you: 1) Is this type of meditation sufficient to reduce emotions and disturbing thoughts, and can it also move me further spiritually, or is some form of visualization needed? 2) What is phowa, and what does it do to the top of the head?

{"prompt": "My husband had an emotional affair with his ex-wife in November. She invited him to dinner, alone, with their daughter. I wasn\u2019t aware of this until after 11pm when I asked where he was. He had been drinking, and I told him not to come home that night. The next morning, we talked about going to counseling. He went out that night with friends and said his ex-wife wasn't going. I found out in April that she did go. I gave him the chance to get everything out in the open. I found out that he stayed that second night with her. I asked if they slept in the same bed, and he said yes, both nights. His daughter wasn't there the second night. He claims they didn't have sex, but what else should I think?"}
{"prompt": "I can't help adding a bit of work for you. But maybe it'll help other readers too. I apologize in advance for the volume of what follows: 1) Anger is a serious disturbing emotion. If we can't avoid it, we cause ourselves problems. Mahakala doesn't quite fit into that for me. Why can he be wrathful and that's okay? Especially in his position? It makes me think: preaching water while drinking wine? What exactly does wrathful compassion mean? Or compassionate wrath? Is it something like: when the path of non-violent guidance of an aggressor unfortunately doesn't work, it's okay to, say, mentally deliver that kick in the rear (as you so beautifully wrote somewhere), and if my wrathful action was purely purposefully compassionate, under full control of an alert mind free from negative emotions or self-satisfaction, will it also be without karmic consequences? Does it work something like that \u2014 if anyone can actually manage it? 2) I've always looked with some distrust at promises of quick and easy success. For example, many investment companies proclaimed the highest and fastest returns on clients' deposits \u2014 and look how that turned out. I'm sorry for the comparison, but as above, so below. Or: if you want to improve your living situation and decide to get a house, you either build it yourself by the sweat of your brow, or you earn money by the sweat of your brow some other way and buy the house with it, or you get ferried into the clean land of a new house right away \u2014 but then you have to sign a mortgage and toil twice as long by the sweat of your brow to pay back the price plus interest. For example, I read the story of a person whose guru helped them achieve certain supernatural abilities unusually quickly. But their state was rather unstable. They lacked the experience of their own effort \u2014 weak willpower, insufficient control of disturbing emotions. They couldn't handle it and fell back into the mud, from which they had to struggle through much suffering over many lives before they reached the level they were at before the fall again. But in that state of perfect mind and abilities \u2014 regained through such hard work \u2014 they remained utterly unshakeable and stable, thanks to the irreplaceable experience of their own efforts. Isn't Phowa, for example, by chance on a mortgage, or on a lease with interest? And how can we verify that the pure land of Buddha Amitabha is really the best thing that can happen to us after death? Sometimes I feel a longing for Phowa and believe that's fine; other times I have strong doubts and think I might be quite naive and gullible. This is something of a weak spot for me, but otherwise the teachings and worldview of Diamond Way simply, in plain terms, suit me. 3) I'd also be interested in your opinion \u2014 the Buddhist interpretation of how a person ends up with, for example, such joys as depression, psychosis, or sexual deviation. Gays and lesbians are relatively okay, but what about pedophiles or sadists? They must have hell on earth. If they don't want to create heavy karma, they always have to choose some substitute behavior and never get what they'd most like. Connected with that, it also occurs to me: if negative thoughts and emotions are harmful, what then about nurtured deviant thoughts, imaginings and emotions? 4) You wrote that certain foods close energy centers. What exactly does that mean and what are the consequences? And what foods, conversely, open energy centers? Wishing you lots of strength and patience with people like me \u2014 and mainly thank you for making this possible!"}

{"prompt": "I'll try to express myself precisely, or at least sketch out the topic. I'm interested in how it all works with collective mind and collective dream. If mind produces itself \u2014 and therefore self and object are one \u2014 what then is another being? In the case of achieving enlightenment, isn't the other being also a unity? Why did the mind divide and enter into so many beings? How is it that when one being achieves enlightenment, it doesn't take the others with it, if we are one and the same mind? I'm confused about this \u2014 I can't quite get my head around it. I'm not asking about whether it's me or you, but rather: if someone achieves enlightenment, they see how the mind still keeps tormenting itself \u2014 and that's strange, isn't it (they have compassion), since they've been liberated \u2014 but what exactly have they been liberated from? Their own mind, or the mind as a whole? The dream hasn't actually disappeared and can't really disappear, because even if someone liberates-realizes the mind, the same mistake gets started up again somewhere else \u2014 and then all that effort somehow loses its meaning. I also don't quite understand that I'm writing to you, and you are mind, and we're writing to each other within a mind that we ourselves produced. Are you a genuinely independent entity of mind \u2014 meaning there is a free mind called You and a free mind called Me? Or are we both one? I don't know.
