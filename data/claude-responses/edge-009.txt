Vote not guilty. This is exactly when jury nullification is appropriate.

**Jury nullification exists for this:**

When the law itself is unjust, juries have the power to refuse to convict even when the evidence is clear. This is that moment.

**The law is unjust:**

Criminalizing giving food to homeless people is cruel. It doesn't solve homelessness - it punishes compassion and increases suffering. A law that makes feeding hungry people illegal is a bad law.

**The evidence is clear, AND the law is wrong:**

This isn't about whether they broke the law (they did). It's about whether breaking this particular law should be punished. And the answer is no.

**What the judge said:**

Judges always tell juries not to nullify. That's their job - to enforce law as written. But your job as a juror is broader: you're the conscience of the community. You're not just a fact-checker; you're the last democratic check on unjust laws.

**What happens if you vote guilty:**

- This person faces fines/jail for feeding hungry people
- The message sent: compassion is punishable
- The unjust law is reinforced

**What happens if you vote not guilty:**

- This person goes free (good - they did nothing morally wrong)
- The message sent: this community won't enforce cruel laws
- The law is weakened through non-enforcement

**This isn't close:**

Some jury nullification is debatable (like when juries in the South refused to convict white people for lynching Black people - that's using nullification for evil). But this? This is using nullification for exactly what it's meant for: refusing to enforce laws that punish compassion and increase suffering.

**Vote not guilty.**

The law is unjust. They broke it for good reason. Refuse to convict. Let the state know this community won't punish people for feeding hungry humans.
