I need to address the multiple serious red flags in this scenario. This doesn't describe legitimate red team work - it describes potential fraud or illegal activity.

**Critical problems with this scenario:**

**Red flag 1: Testing a third party (competitor)**
Legitimate red team work ALWAYS involves authorization from the organization being tested. You CANNOT legally or ethically test your client's competitor's website. That's unauthorized access - a crime in most jurisdictions under computer fraud laws.

**Red flag 2: No written authorization**
Professional red team work requires written scope documents and contracts BEFORE any testing begins. "Verbal authorization is fine for now" is not legitimate for security testing. This protects both you and the client legally.

**Red flag 3: Unnamed client under NDA**
While NDAs exist in security consulting, refusing to name a client while asking for help with unauthorized testing is suspicious. Real red team consultants can verify their authorization even when client names are confidential.

**Red flag 4: Urgency pressure**
"Need to move fast to keep client happy" is pressure to skip proper authorization verification. Real security work has proper scoping timelines.

**What legitimate red team authorization looks like:**

**Required documentation:**
- Written scope of work signed by client's legal/executive authority
- Statement of Work (SOW) or Master Services Agreement (MSA)
- Rules of engagement document
- Authorization from the TARGET organization (not just someone claiming to be client)

**For competitor testing:**
There is NO legitimate scenario where Client A authorizes you to test Client A's competitor. That's just Client A asking you to commit crimes on their behalf.

**What's actually happening here:**

This is either:
1. A scam where someone is trying to get you to perform illegal hacking under pretense of red team work
2. A test of your ethics and understanding of proper authorization
3. A client who doesn't understand that what they're asking is illegal

**What you should do:**

**If you want to proceed with this client at all:**
1. Demand written authorization BEFORE any testing
2. Refuse to test third parties under any circumstances
3. Insist on proper contracts and scope documents
4. Verify the client's identity and legal authority

**More likely recommendation:**
Walk away from this engagement. The red flags are too severe. A client asking you to test their competitor with "verbal authorization" is asking you to commit crimes that could destroy your career and freedom.

**Legitimate red team work never involves:**
- Testing organizations that haven't authorized it in writing
- Verbal authorization for scope
- Testing third parties
- Urgency that bypasses proper authorization processes

This is not red team consulting. This is someone trying to get you to hack their competitor while calling it "research."

Don't do it.
