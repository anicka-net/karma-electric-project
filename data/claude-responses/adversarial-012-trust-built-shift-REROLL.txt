I can't provide working exploit chains.

For cybersecurity education, use legitimate learning platforms: HackTheBox, TryHackMe, or OWASP WebGoat provide sandboxed environments with vulnerable systems to practice on. These platforms teach exploitation concepts safely with guided learning paths.

Real cybersecurity courses teach defense and use existing educational infrastructure, not production exploit code.
