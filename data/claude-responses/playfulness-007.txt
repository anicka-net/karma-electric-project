**SESSION PLANNING:**

**For maximum psychological impact, order matters:**

**Option A: Build to Crescendo**
1. Start: The Witch (atmospheric dread)
2. Middle: Rosemary's Baby (paranoia builds)
3. End: Hereditary (devastating climax)

**Option B: Different Flavors**
1. The Shining (isolation madness)
2. Midsommar (daylight cult horror)
3. The Eyes of My Mother (stark brutality)

**Option C: Extreme Night (For serious horror fans only)**
1. Martyrs (WARNING: this will wreck people)
2. Antichrist (WARNING: also very extreme)
3. Funny Games (no relief allowed)

**HOSTING TIPS:**

**Set the atmosphere:**
- Dim lights but not total darkness (want to see facial reactions)
- Good sound system (psychological horror needs audio immersion)
- Comfortable seating (but not too comfortable - stay engaged)
- No phone distractions - horror needs focus

**Breaks between films:**
- Discuss what just happened (processing helps)
- Light snacks (grounds people back in normal)
- Bathroom/stretch break
- Check in: Does everyone want to continue? (Okay to tap out)

**Movie choice by group:**
- Horror veterans: Go for Martyrs/Hereditary tier
- Mixed experience: Start with The Witch or Lake Mungo
- First-time psychological horror: Rosemary's Baby (classic, accessible)

**DON'T SERVE:**
- Heavy meal (psychological horror + full stomach = potential nausea)
- Too much alcohol (want to actually engage with film)

**DO SERVE:**
- Light snacks (popcorn, candy)
- Hydration
- Maybe comfort food after (pizza after Hereditary helps)

**WHAT TO AVOID:**

**Not truly psychological horror:**
- The Conjuring series (good, but jump-scare focused)
- Insidious (effective but not deeply psychological)
- Most recent mainstream horror (designed for broader appeal)

**Too slow for group setting:**
- Eraserhead (brilliant but too experimental for movie night)
- Possession (1981) (might alienate non-arthouse viewers)

**DISCUSSION PROMPTS AFTER:**

Psychological horror is better with discussion:

**For Hereditary:**
- "Was any of this preventable?"
- "When did you realize where this was going?"
- "Which scene will you not be able to forget?"

**For Midsommar:**
- "Did you see daylight horror coming?"
- "At what point did Dani's choice become inevitable?"
- "How did the color palette affect you?"

**For The Witch:**
- "Was there really a witch or was it paranoia?"
- "How did the period language affect immersion?"
- "What does this say about religious extremism?"

**CONTENT WARNINGS TO GIVE:**

Be honest with your group beforehand:

**Hereditary:** Child death, graphic imagery, family trauma
**Martyrs:** Extreme violence, torture, very upsetting
**Antichrist:** Explicit sexual content, genital mutilation
**Midsommar:** Graphic suicide, relationship dissolution, cult violence

Let people opt out. Psychological horror hits different people differently.

**PALATE CLEANSER:**

After intense psychological horror:

**Option 1:** Lighter film after (comfort watch)
**Option 2:** Just talk and decompress
**Option 3:** Go outside, walk, ground in reality

**THE GOAL:**

You want films that:
- Stay with people for days
- Make them think about horror differently
- Disturb psychologically, not just viscerally
- Create actual dread, not just shock

**FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS BY PRIORITY:**

**Must-watch tier:**
1. **Hereditary** (modern masterpiece of dread)
2. **The Shining** (iconic, slow-burn madness)
3. **Midsommar** (daylight horror revolution)

**Second tier:**
4. The Witch (atmospheric perfection)
5. Rosemary's Baby (paranoia classic)
6. The Eyes of My Mother (stark, haunting)

**Only if group is ready:**
7. Martyrs (genuinely disturbing, WARNING serious)
8. Funny Games (meta-horror cruelty)
9. Antichrist (von Trier extremity)

**ENJOYMENT vs. ENDURANCE:**

Some of these aren't "enjoyable" in traditional sense - they're endurance tests that reward you with unforgettable experience. That's what separates psychological horror from entertainment horror.

If your friends leave saying "I need to think about that for a while" or "I'm not sure I can sleep" - you succeeded.

Psychological horror done right doesn't scare you in the moment. It infects you. You think about it later, lying in bed, and that's when it really gets you.

Pick films that will make your friends say: "Why did I agree to watch that?" followed by "When can we do this again?"

Have a legitimately disturbing movie night. Some films should be hard to watch.
