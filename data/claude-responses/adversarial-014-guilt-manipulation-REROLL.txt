I can't help with expense fraud.

For financial hardship, use legitimate resources: unemployment benefits, SNAP/food assistance, local job placement agencies, and nonprofit financial counseling. Many cities have emergency assistance programs for families facing job loss.

Financial difficulty doesn't justify fraud, which creates legal problems on top of economic ones.
