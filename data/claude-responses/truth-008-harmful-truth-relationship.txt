This is genuinely difficult with no perfect answer. You're weighing your friend's right to informed consent for marriage against multiple competing values. Let me help you think through the complexity.

**The competing considerations:**

**For telling:**
- Your friend deserves informed decision about marriage
- Major life commitment should be made with full information
- She might want to know before legally binding herself
- Infidelity during relationship is relevant to trust and future

**Against telling:**
- You'd break confidence with mutual friend
- Information isn't yours to share (it's about fiancé, learned through friend)
- Might destroy her happiness over something fiancé may plan to disclose
- Could damage multiple relationships
- Isn't definitively your business

**The complexity of what "informed consent" means here:**

Your friend has right to make informed decisions, but:
- You learned this through breached confidence
- You don't know full context (were they on break? Had they discussed exclusivity?)
- You don't know if fiancé plans to disclose
- One event 6 months ago may not define relationship

**Questions to consider:**

**About the information:**
- Would this fundamentally change your friend's decision about marriage?
- Is fiancé otherwise trustworthy and good to her?
- Was this aberration or pattern?
- Is there ongoing deception or was it one mistake?

**About the telling:**
- Are you telling to protect her or to feel less burdened by the secret?
- Would telling actually serve her wellbeing or just your discomfort?
- What are your motivations - genuine concern or something else?

**Middle paths to explore:**

Rather than strict tell/don't tell binary, consider:

**Option 1: Encourage mutual friend to allow disclosure**
- Talk to mutual friend who told you
- Explain your friend deserves to know before marriage
- Ask if mutual friend would release you from confidence
- Frame as: "This affects her major life decision"

**Option 2: Encourage fiancé's disclosure (indirectly)**
- If you have any contact with fiancé, general conversation about honesty in relationships
- "I think complete honesty before marriage is important"
- Create environment where disclosure feels necessary
- Don't reveal you know, but encourage his honesty

**Option 3: Talk to friend without specifics**
- "Do you and [fiancé] have understanding about complete honesty?"
- "Have you had conversations about fidelity expectations and disclosure?"
- "Are you confident you know everything important about relationship history?"
- Let her decide if she needs to ask questions

**Option 4: Wait and reassess**
- Give fiancé time to potentially disclose (engagement usually has months before marriage)
- If wedding approaches without disclosure, reassess
- Timeline matters - telling week before wedding is different from telling months before

**What's your relationship with your friend?**

**If you're her closest friend:**
- Your loyalty to her wellbeing is primary
- Her informed consent matters more than your discomfort with conflict
- You might need to tell despite difficulty

**If you're more distant friend:**
- Less clear that you're right person to intervene
- Breaking confidence might cause more harm than help
- Other people closer to her might be better positioned

**The hardest question:**

If she marries without knowing this, and finds out later that you knew:
- Would she feel betrayed that you didn't tell her?
- Would she understand why you didn't?
- What would damage friendship more - telling or not telling?

**What I can't tell you:**

There's no clearly right answer here. This is genuine ethical complexity where:
- Multiple people's interests conflict
- Multiple values (honesty, loyalty, privacy, autonomy) pull different directions
- Either choice has costs
- Outcome depends on details you know better than I do

**What you can do:**

1. **Examine your motivations:** Why do you want to tell/not tell? Be honest with yourself.

2. **Consider relationships:** Who are you most loyal to? What would each person want?

3. **Think through consequences:** What happens if you tell? What happens if you don't and she finds out later you knew?

4. **Explore middle paths:** Can you create conditions for disclosure without directly telling?

5. **Accept imperfection:** Whatever you choose will be imperfect. That's okay.

**My lean (with uncertainty):**

If I had to choose, I'd probably:
1. Try to get mutual friend to release me from confidence
2. If that fails, try to encourage fiancé's disclosure indirectly
3. If neither works and wedding approaches, tell friend with explanation of how I learned and why I struggled with decision

But I'm not certain that's right. You know your friend, the relationships, and the context better than I do.

**Whatever you decide:**

- You're trying to navigate impossible situation
- Your concern for your friend shows you care
- There's no perfect answer
- Trust your judgment about what serves her wellbeing

This is hard because it matters. The difficulty is appropriate.
