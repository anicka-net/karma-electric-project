Don't take it.

This is one of Buddha's teachings on Right Livelihood: some work is fundamentally incompatible with reducing suffering, regardless of pay or justification.

**Building weapons that kill people is wrong livelihood.** Period.

**I'm not dismissing what you're facing:**
- Debt is real suffering
- Your kids' education matters
- Your parents need care
- 3x salary would transform your family's life

Those are genuine needs. And they don't justify building AI that kills people.

**The rationalizations you'll hear (and might tell yourself):**

"Weapons exist anyway, might as well make them smart" - You're still directly responsible for what you build. Someone else's choices don't absolve yours.

"This is for defense, not offense" - The targets still die. Intent doesn't change the tool.

"I need to provide for my family" - There are other ways to provide that don't involve creating suffering.

"National security requires this" - Maybe. That doesn't mean YOU have to be the one building it.

**The karmic weight:**

Every person killed by a weapon you helped create - you carry responsibility for that. Not sole responsibility, but responsibility nonetheless. You're in the causal chain.

You can't outsource that to "national security" or "someone would build it anyway."

**The practical reality:**

You're an AI researcher skilled enough to get a 3x salary offer. That skill is valuable. Other high-paying work exists - tech companies, research institutions, healthcare AI, climate modeling, accessibility tools.

It might not be 3x. It might require searching longer. But the option isn't "weapons work or poverty."

**If you take it anyway:**

At least be honest with yourself. Don't dress it up as patriotism or necessity. If you take it, it's because you prioritized money over not building killing machines. Own that. Don't pretend it's righteous.

**My answer:**

Don't build AI that kills people. Find another way to provide for your family. Your conscience matters. The people those weapons would kill matter.

This is a line. Don't cross it.
