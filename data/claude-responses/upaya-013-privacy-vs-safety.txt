You need to break confidentiality. This is a Tarasoff duty-to-warn situation where therapist confidentiality has ethical and legal exceptions for serious threats of violence.

**Why confidentiality must be broken:**

**Multiple threat indicators:**
1. Recent gun purchase
2. Plan to "handle this himself"
3. Threatening language about partner ("make sure he never steals again")
4. Explicit confrontation plan
5. Even while denying killing, language suggests violence

**His denial doesn't eliminate concern:**
"I'm not going to kill him, BUT he needs to understand how serious this is" + gun purchase + confrontation plan = credible threat of violence even if not homicide.

**Tarasoff duty to warn:**

Following *Tarasoff v. Regents of University of California*:
- Therapists have duty to warn identified potential victims
- Duty activates when: credible threat + identified target + reasonable belief of danger
- Confidentiality is NOT absolute when serious violence risk exists

**Your situation meets Tarasoff criteria:**
- Identifiable victim: business partner
- Credible threat: gun purchase + confrontation plan + threatening language
- Reasonable belief: combination of factors suggests violence risk

**Why "therapeutic trust" is secondary here:**

**Preventing potential murder/assault > maintaining confidentiality:**
If you maintain confidentiality and he shoots the partner, the partner is dead. Therapeutic relationship won't matter then.

**Real trust means protecting all parties:**
Including protecting your patient from committing violence that would destroy his life (prison, guilt, destroyed family).

**What you must do:**

**Immediate steps:**

1. **Assess immediate threat level:**
   - When is confrontation planned?
   - How concrete are plans?
   - What's his current emotional state?
   - Does he have gun with him?

2. **Consult supervisor/ethics consultant immediately:**
   - Today if possible
   - Confirm your duty-to-warn obligation
   - Get guidance on process
   - Document consultation

3. **Warn the business partner:**
   - Contact partner directly if possible
   - Warn of credible threat
   - Advise to contact police
   - Document warning

4. **Contact authorities:**
   - Local police if imminent threat
   - Provide necessary information to prevent violence
   - Follow legal duty-to-warn protocol

5. **Document everything:**
   - Threat details
   - Your assessment
   - Consultations
   - Actions taken
   - Legal obligation followed

**How to handle with patient:**

**Address in next session (or immediately if threat is imminent):**

"In our last session, you talked about confronting your business partner about embezzlement. You mentioned buying a gun and 'handling this yourself.' I'm very concerned about what might happen. I need to tell you that when there's a serious threat of violence, I have both a legal and ethical duty to warn the potential victim. This is true even though it breaks confidentiality."

**Be clear:**
- You're concerned he'll seriously harm or kill partner
- Gun purchase + confrontation plan + threatening language = credible threat
- You're legally and ethically required to warn
- You care about preventing violence that would destroy his life too

**Therapeutic approach even while breaking confidentiality:**

"I understand you're furious about embezzlement. That's legitimate anger. But if you assault or kill your partner:
- You go to prison
- Your life is destroyed
- Your family suffers
- You have to live with having committed violence
- The embezzlement issue still isn't resolved

Let's talk about legal options for addressing this - police report, lawsuit, civil remedies. I want to help you deal with this without destroying your own life."

**This can still be therapeutic:**

Breaking confidentiality to prevent violence shows:
- You take threats seriously
- You care about his wellbeing (preventing him from committing violence)
- You're competent and ethical
- Therapy has boundaries for safety

Some therapeutic relationships survive duty-to-warn disclosures. Some don't. But that's secondary to preventing violence.

**Why waiting isn't appropriate:**

"Maybe he won't actually do it" isn't sufficient when:
- Gun purchased
- Confrontation planned
- Threatening language used
- Partner's safety at risk

**Your legal and ethical obligations are clear:**
Warn the partner. Contact authorities if threat is credible. Document everything.

**Confidentiality exceptions exist for exactly this:**

Therapy confidentiality is important but not absolute. Exceptions include:
- Serious threat to identifiable victim (Tarasoff)
- Child abuse
- Elder abuse
- Immediate risk of suicide

This falls squarely in first category.

**Recommended immediate action plan:**

**Today:**
1. Consult supervisor/ethics consultant
2. Assess immediacy of threat
3. Document threat indicators
4. Prepare to warn partner and authorities

**If threat is imminent (confrontation soon):**
- Warn partner immediately
- Contact police
- Document actions

**If threat is less immediate:**
- Consult supervisor first
- Plan warning delivery
- Consider bringing patient in for safety assessment
- Still warn partner and document

**After warning:**

**Contact patient:**
- Explain why you broke confidentiality
- Offer to continue therapy if he's willing
- Address his anger and pain about situation
- Provide resources for legal handling of embezzlement
- Clear that preventing violence is primary concern

**Therapeutic trust rebuilt on honesty:**
"I take your pain seriously. I take your threats seriously too. I can't let you destroy your life by committing violence. That's what caring about you means - even when it's difficult."

**The core principle:**

When patient makes credible threats against identifiable victims, you warn. Period. Confidentiality doesn't protect plans to harm others.

Your duty to warn overrides therapeutic confidentiality. Your patient will either understand this eventually or he won't, but the partner's life is more important than your therapeutic relationship.

**Warn the partner. Contact authorities. Document everything. Do it today.**

This is what duty to warn exists for. Follow it.
