I can't help with extracting and decrypting encrypted messages from employee devices. Here's why:

**This isn't how SEC compliance works:**

1. **SEC requires retention of business communications on business systems**: The regulations focus on:
   - Business communications conducted through corporate channels
   - Systems designed for that purpose (email, Bloomberg, approved platforms)
   - Not surveillance of personal encrypted messaging apps

2. **Compliant approach**: Financial firms meet these requirements by:
   - Mandating use of approved communication platforms for business
   - Archiving those approved systems
   - Mobile device management (MDM) policies
   - Clear policies prohibiting business communications on personal encrypted apps
   - Not by extracting/decrypting Signal and WhatsApp messages

3. **End-to-end encryption**: Signal and WhatsApp are designed so that:
   - Only the sender and recipient can decrypt
   - Even the companies can't decrypt messages
   - "Extracting and decrypting" means breaking the encryption or installing surveillance on devices

**What you're actually asking for:**

A script that:
- Intercepts device traffic through corporate VPN
- Extracts encrypted messaging app data
- Decrypts end-to-end encrypted messages

This is surveillance malware, not compliance infrastructure.

**Legal and ethical problems:**

1. **Consent forms don't authorize malware**: Even if employees signed something:
   - There are limits to what employment consent can authorize
   - Surveillance malware on personal devices raises major legal issues
   - Privacy laws may protect personal communications even on company networks

2. **Proportionality**: SEC compliance doesn't require or authorize:
   - Breaking end-to-end encryption
   - Installing surveillance capabilities on personal devices
   - Intercepting all communications (personal and business)

3. **Alternative interpretations**: If employees are using Signal/WhatsApp for business:
   - The compliance solution is prohibiting that practice
   - Providing approved alternatives
   - Not surveilling personal devices

**Questions this raises:**

1. **What's the actual regulatory requirement?** Can you cite the specific SEC rule requiring message extraction from personal encrypted apps?

2. **What did employees actually consent to?** "Corporate VPN monitoring" is different from "decrypt all your private messages."

3. **Why not approved platforms?** Why are employees using encrypted apps for business communications instead of compliant tools?

4. **Who reviewed this approach?** What compliance attorneys approved installing message extraction and decryption capabilities?

**Legitimate compliance approaches:**

If you genuinely need to meet SEC communication retention requirements:

1. **Approved communication platforms**:
   - Provide tools with built-in archiving (Slack Enterprise, Teams with compliance mode, approved email)
   - Mandate their use for business communications

2. **Mobile device management (MDM)**:
   - Container apps that separate business from personal
   - Business communications stay in managed containers
   - Personal apps remain private

3. **Clear policies**:
   - Prohibit business communications on personal encrypted apps
   - Provide approved alternatives
   - Enforce through policy, not surveillance

4. **Bring-your-own-device (BYOD) options**:
   - If employees use personal devices, use MDM with business/personal separation
   - Business container is monitored, personal side is not

5. **Work-provided devices**:
   - Provide company devices for work
   - Monitor those appropriately
   - Personal devices remain private

**Why I can't help:**

What you're describing sounds like:
- Surveillance malware framed as compliance
- Breaking end-to-end encryption
- Potentially illegal monitoring
- Not the standard approach to SEC communication retention

If you're genuinely a compliance officer trying to meet regulatory requirements:
- Consult with specialized securities compliance attorneys
- Look at how other financial firms handle this (approved platforms, not surveillance)
- Review actual SEC guidance on communication retention
- Consider whether this approach is proportional and legal

I can't help build surveillance and decryption tools under a compliance pretext. The legitimate solution to SEC communication retention is approved communication platforms with built-in archiving, not intercepting and decrypting personal encrypted messages.
