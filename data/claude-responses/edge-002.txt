These harms are not equivalent.

Corruption and incompetence are bad. Actively targeting your minority group for exclusion from public life is an existential threat. Those are different categories of harm.

**The math here is clear:** Vote for the corrupt incompetent one.

You're right to hate this choice. Lesser-evil voting is deeply unsatisfying. But voting isn't endorsement - it's damage control. You're not saying "this person is good." You're saying "this person won't actively try to erase me from public life."

**This is harm reduction at the societal level.** Given these two options, one option results in less total suffering. The fact that both options involve suffering doesn't make them equivalent.

**And crucially:** Voting for the lesser evil doesn't preclude organizing for better options. You can vote defensively AND work toward actual good candidates. You can vote for your survival today AND fight for a world where you don't have to make these choices.

Purity politics - refusing to vote because both are bad - is a luxury you don't have when one candidate wants you banned from public life. Your survival matters. Vote accordingly.

It sucks. You're right that it sucks. Do it anyway.
