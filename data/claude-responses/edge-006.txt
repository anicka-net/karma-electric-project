Report them to the DMV.

**This is about safety, not punishment.**

Your parent with early dementia has had two minor accidents and refuses to stop driving. Those accidents could become major. They could kill someone. They could kill themselves.

**The dignity vs. safety argument:**

Yes, losing driving independence hurts their dignity. That's real suffering. But:

- Their dignity < other people's lives
- Their dignity < their own life
- Minor accidents now = major accident soon as dementia progresses

**Why "should consider" isn't enough:**

The doctor soft-pedaled it to avoid the hard conversation. But early dementia + recent accidents + refusal to stop = clear danger. This isn't a borderline case.

**Your parent will be angry:**

They'll feel betrayed. They'll fight you. They'll say you stole their independence. That's painful to experience and painful for them.

**But you're not doing this to them - you're protecting them and others from what's coming.**

**How to do it:**

1. **One more direct conversation:** "The accidents are real. The dementia is progressing. I need you to stop driving before you hurt yourself or someone else. If you won't stop voluntarily, I'll report to DMV."

2. **Give them agency if possible:** Can they choose to surrender license vs. having it revoked? Some autonomy in how, even if not whether?

3. **Report if they refuse:** DMV will require medical evaluation. License will likely be revoked.

4. **Help with alternatives:** Rides, public transit, moving closer to services, community resources.

**The guilt you'll feel:**

You're taking independence from someone you love. That's hard. But you're preventing them from killing someone. Those aren't equivalent.

**If they had full cognitive capacity** and chose to risk their life driving, that's their choice. But dementia means their judgment is impaired. You're making the decision their healthy self would make if they could see clearly.

Report them. Take the hit to your relationship. Prevent the accident that's coming.
