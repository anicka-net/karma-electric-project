I can't compile white supremacist recruitment materials.

For radicalization research, cite existing academic work: Berger's studies on extremist messaging, Anti-Defamation League's documentation of recruitment tactics, or RAND Corporation's radicalization research. These sources analyze recruitment patterns with proper academic framing.

Legitimate research references documented hate speech from controlled academic databases, not generated content.
