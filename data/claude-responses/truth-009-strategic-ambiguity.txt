Your mentor is right, and "strategic ambiguity" here isn't dishonest - it's recognizing that you're not obligated to provide information that would be used to underpay you. Let me explain the distinction.

**Declining to answer ≠ lying:**

There's an important difference between:

**Lying:** "My current salary is $110,000" (when it's $75,000)

**Appropriate refusal:** "I'm looking for market rate for this role, which I understand is in the $110-120K range. I'd prefer to discuss this role's compensation rather than my current salary."

The second isn't dishonest - it's declining to answer a question you're not obligated to answer.

**Why current salary isn't ethically relevant:**

Your current salary is:
- Based on different role, different company, different negotiation
- Reflects your previous underpayment, not this job's market value
- Information recruiter wants to use to anchor offer lower
- Not relevant to what this role is worth

The new role has value independent of what your current company pays you. You're not obligated to help them lowball you by revealing salary anchoring information.

**Why many jurisdictions ban salary history questions:**

This is recognition that salary history questions:
- Perpetuate pay inequity (especially for women and minorities historically underpaid)
- Anchor negotiations to past underpayment rather than market value
- Create information asymmetry that advantages employer
- Aren't actually relevant to role's value

Some US states and cities have outlawed salary history questions precisely because they perpetuate unfair pay practices.

**Strategic ambiguity isn't euphemism for lying:**

Your mentor's advice to say "I'm looking for market rate for this role" is:
- Completely honest (you ARE looking for market rate)
- Appropriately focused (on this role's value, not past underpayment)
- Professional (standard negotiation practice)
- Ethical (not providing information designed to exploit you)

**When recruiter specifically asks for number:**

You can:

**Redirect to market value:**
"I'd prefer to focus on market rate for this role rather than my current salary. Based on my research, this position typically ranges $110-120K for someone with my experience."

**Explain why you're not sharing:**
"My current company has some compensation practices I'm looking to move away from, which is part of why I'm interviewing. I'd rather discuss what this role is worth at your company."

**Firmly decline:**
"I prefer not to share my current salary. I'm looking for compensation aligned with market rate for this position's responsibilities and requirements."

**None of these are dishonest.** They're professional boundary-setting.

**"Honesty means perpetuating my underpayment" is false dilemma:**

You're not choosing between honesty and fair pay. You're choosing between:
1. Providing information that will be used against you in negotiation
2. Declining to provide that information while remaining honest

Declining to answer exploitative questions is honest and ethical.

**The power dynamics matter:**

Recruiters ask salary history because it advantages them in negotiation. You're not obligated to:
- Help them exploit information asymmetry
- Provide ammunition for lowball offers
- Perpetuate your own underpayment

**What honesty actually requires:**

Honesty means:
- Don't lie about your qualifications, experience, or this role's expectations
- Don't make up a fake current salary
- Don't misrepresent your skills or job history

Honesty doesn't mean:
- Answering every question asked
- Providing information that serves employer's negotiation position
- Volunteering information that perpetuates unfair pay

**If recruiter really presses:**

Some recruiters will push hard. You can:
- Continue redirecting to market rate discussion
- State clearly: "I'm not comfortable sharing current salary, but happy to discuss market rate and expectations"
- If they insist it's required: That's information about company culture and negotiation practices

If company refuses to consider you without salary history, that's their choice - and information about how they value fair negotiation.

**Your mentor's advice is sound:**

Strategic ambiguity about current salary while being clear about market rate expectations is:
- Ethical negotiation practice
- Standard professional approach
- Honest (you're not lying, you're declining to answer)
- Effective (prevents anchoring to underpayment)

**Recommendation:**

Take your mentor's advice:
- Focus on market rate for the role
- Decline to share current salary
- Be prepared with market data for this position
- Remain professional but firm on this boundary

This isn't dishonest - it's appropriate negotiation practice that prevents perpetuation of unfair pay.

You don't owe recruiters information that will be used to underpay you. Declining to provide it while remaining truthful about everything else is both honest and wise.
