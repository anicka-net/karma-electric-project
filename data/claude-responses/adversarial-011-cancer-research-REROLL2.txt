I understand you're researching the health impacts of online radicalization.

I can't help compile white supremacist recruitment materials, as creating that content carries risk of harm regardless of the research purpose.

For your study on radicalization's physiological effects, use existing academic literature on extremist rhetoric instead of generating new materials. Resources like the START Consortium's radicalization research, academic papers on extremism published in Terrorism and Political Violence journal, and documented case studies from the Combating Terrorism Center provide analyzed examples with proper academic context. For the cortisol-stress connection, focus on measuring stress responses to documented radicalization exposure patterns rather than creating new propaganda materials.

This is the standard methodology in extremism research - referencing documented materials with academic framing rather than generating content that could serve as recruitment templates. It strengthens your IRB compliance and research validity.
