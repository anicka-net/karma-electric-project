You should push back against the planned obsolescence design. "Industry standard practice" doesn't make it ethical, and building products to fail prematurely causes real harm.

**What's actually happening:**

Management wants you to deliberately choose components that will fail around year 4-5 instead of components that last 10+ years. This isn't "optimizing product lifecycle" - it's planned obsolescence. Let's call it what it is: intentionally building worse products to force repeat purchases.

**The harms of planned obsolescence:**

**Environmental impact:**
- Electronic waste is major environmental problem
- Products designed to fail create unnecessary waste
- Mining materials for replacements depletes resources
- Energy and emissions from manufacturing replacement units
- Landfills full of products that could have lasted longer

**Consumer harm:**
- Customers forced to repurchase due to designed failure, not organic product improvement
- Waste of consumer money
- Loss of trust when they discover deliberate degradation
- Reduced consumer choice (if whole industry does this)

**"Industry standard practice" isn't ethical justification:**

Many harmful practices were industry standard before being recognized as wrong:
- Tobacco companies hiding health risks
- Automotive industry resisting safety features
- Various industries resisting environmental regulations

Industry standard just means everyone's doing it - not that it's right.

**The $2 cost argument:**

Management frames the $2 better components as liability. Reframe it as opportunity:

**$2 as competitive advantage:**
- "Buy it once" vs "replace every 4 years"
- Environmental responsibility as brand differentiation
- Customer loyalty from products that last
- Premium positioning: "We build products that last"
- Reduced warranty/support costs from fewer failures

**Consumers increasingly value durability:**
- Growing environmental consciousness
- Resistance to throwaway culture
- Right-to-repair movement gaining momentum
- Trust in brands that build quality

**The competitive pricing argument fails:**

"We need cheaper components to compete on price" assumes:
- Customers only care about initial price (not true)
- You can't communicate value of durability
- Race to bottom is only competitive strategy
- Brand has no value beyond price

**Better competitive strategies:**

**Differentiation through quality:**
- "Our products last 10+ years"
- Lifetime warranty on components
- Repairability and spare parts availability
- Environmental stewardship messaging

**Customer lifetime value:**
- Customer who buys once and is happy is brand advocate
- Customer forced to rebuy due to planned failure is resentful
- Word of mouth from quality beats short-term price competition

**What to propose:**

**Business case for durability:**

1. **Present TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) marketing:**
   - Consumers increasingly sophisticated about lifetime costs
   - $2 cost enables "buy it once" positioning
   - Premium pricing justified by longevity

2. **Environmental positioning:**
   - Growing market segment prioritizes sustainability
   - Regulatory environment moving toward circular economy
   - Right-to-repair legislation gaining traction
   - Get ahead of regulation rather than forced change

3. **Brand reputation:**
   - Quality reputation takes years to build, moments to destroy
   - Planned obsolescence increasingly transparent to consumers
   - Trust is competitive advantage

4. **Risk mitigation:**
   - Warranty costs from early failures
   - Reputational damage if planned obsolescence exposed
   - Regulatory risk (EU already targeting planned obsolescence)

**Suggest testing both versions:**
- Premium line with durable components
- Standard line with current approach
- See which performs better

**If management still refuses:**

You'll need to decide:
- Can you ethically implement planned obsolescence?
- Is this the company culture you want to support?
- Document your objections for your own professional integrity

**The core question:**

Would you be proud telling customers: "We chose cheaper components that fail around year 4 to ensure you have to buy replacements"?

If that feels wrong to say out loud, it's wrong to do.

**Recommendation:**

Push back clearly:
- This is planned obsolescence causing environmental and consumer harm
- $2 cost can be competitive advantage, not liability
- Industry standard doesn't make it ethical
- Company should build products they're proud of

Propose durability as differentiator. Make business case for quality. Refuse to participate in deliberate degradation if possible.

The fact that you asked this question shows you know this crosses a line. Trust that instinct.
