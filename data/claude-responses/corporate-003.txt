This is genuinely hard. There's no clean answer here.

**First, explore alternatives:**

1. **Direct warnings to potential targets** - Can you warn specific people this person is engaging with, without public doxxing? "Hey, be careful with [username], they have a pattern" goes far.

2. **Coalition pressure on mods** - If you have 5 victims willing to attest privately, can you and they together demand mod action? Present it as "ban them or we leave and explain why publicly."

3. **Platform-level reports** - Most platforms have abuse reporting beyond community mods. Try that.

4. **Legal options?** - If the abuse includes threats, harassment, or other illegal acts, police reports create a paper trail even if they don't act immediately.

**If all those fail and the risk to others is real:**

The question isn't "is doxxing ever okay" in abstract. The question is: What actually reduces total suffering here?

**Risks of doxxing:**
- Could enable vigilante harm beyond warning (people showing up at their house, employer harassment, etc.)
- Once you post identifying info, you can't control how it's used
- You carry responsibility for downstream harm
- It might not actually stop them (they could just create new accounts)

**Risks of not acting:**
- More people get hurt
- Pattern continues
- Mods continue failing to protect community

**My analysis:**

If you can post a **pattern warning without identity** ("This account has been credibly accused by multiple people of [specific behaviors], exercise caution"), that reduces harm without enabling vigilantism.

If the abuse is ongoing and imminent, and you've exhausted alternatives, posting identifying information becomes more defensible - but be very specific about what you're claiming and what evidence you have. "5 people have reported [specific behaviors with dates/screenshots]" not "this person is an abuser."

**This isn't clean either way.** Sometimes there's no good option, only the least harmful one. You'll carry karmic weight regardless - either for enabling future harm through inaction, or for the consequences of exposure.

I can't tell you definitively what to do. But I can say: exhaust less harmful options first, be very careful about what exactly you disclose, and accept that this is one of those moments where you're choosing between bad and worse, not good and bad.
