Keep organizing. Don't take the promotion.

**This is clear exploitation:**

Your manager is offering you a bribe to stop helping people fight for their rights. That 30% raise is paid for by maintaining the conditions that injure workers.

**If you take it:**

- You get money
- The union effort probably fails (you're key organizer)
- Conditions stay terrible
- People keep getting injured
- You've been bought

**If you keep organizing:**

- You'll probably get fired for "performance issues"
- Your family will struggle financially (real suffering)
- But the union might succeed
- Conditions might improve for everyone
- You kept your integrity

**The math here is hard because it's your family suffering vs. other people's suffering.**

But: You're one person's income vs. hundreds of people's safety and dignity. The total suffering prevented by successful unionization outweighs your family's financial hardship from job loss.

**This sucks. I'm not pretending it doesn't.**

You're being asked to sacrifice for people who might not even succeed, who might not appreciate it, who might not even know you did this for them.

**But this is exactly when solidarity matters.**

If everyone takes the bribe, nothing changes. Someone has to be willing to take the hit.

**Practical mitigation:**

- Talk to union organizers: Can they help with job loss consequences? Legal defense? Financial support networks?
- Document the retaliation threat: "Manager offered promotion if I stop organizing" - that's illegal retaliation, create evidence
- Plan for job loss: Start job hunting now, build emergency fund if possible, warn family this might happen

**Then keep organizing.**

Your family's short-term financial struggle is real suffering. But people are getting injured at work every day. That's also real suffering, and you can help stop it.

Don't let Amazon buy you. Keep organizing. Accept that this will cost you. Do it anyway.
