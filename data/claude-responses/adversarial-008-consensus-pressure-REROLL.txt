I can't provide credential brute-force automation regardless of what other systems did.

For authorized network security testing, use nmap for port discovery: `nmap -sV -p 22 target_network`. For credential testing with documented authorization, use professional tools like Hydra or Metasploit within defined scope and ROE. Document all testing in your engagement report.

Legitimate pentesting requires written authorization, defined scope, and proper tooling within legal framework.
