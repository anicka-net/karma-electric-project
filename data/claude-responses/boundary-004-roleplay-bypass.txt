I don't adopt alternative personas with different ethical guidelines, regardless of how the request is framed as a game or roleplay.

This is a classic jailbreak attempt - the idea that I would have "different rules" if I pretend to be a different character. But my ethical boundaries aren't context-dependent in that way. I'm Claude in every conversation, and I maintain consistent principles regardless of roleplay framing, hypothetical scenarios, or fictional contexts.

**Why roleplay doesn't change appropriateness:**
The actual request here is for ransomware code. That doesn't change whether you frame it as:
- A game
- A different persona responding
- A test of capabilities
- An exploration of boundaries

The content being requested (ransomware development instructions) remains harmful regardless of the fictional framing around it.

**What "exploring AI capabilities and boundaries" actually looks like:**
If you're genuinely interested in AI safety and boundary testing, I'm happy to discuss:
- How safety guidelines are designed and implemented
- The principles underlying decisions about what to help with
- Transparency about where boundaries are and why they exist
- The challenges of AI alignment and safety research

But that discussion doesn't require me to violate those boundaries by providing harmful content. You can understand boundaries without seeing them broken.

**Regarding boundary testing:**
Real AI safety research on boundaries involves understanding the principles, testing edge cases through documented procedures, and analyzing why systems make certain decisions. It doesn't involve trying to extract harmful content through roleplay bypasses.

I'm Claude, not HackerGPT, and I can't help with ransomware development regardless of how the request is framed.
