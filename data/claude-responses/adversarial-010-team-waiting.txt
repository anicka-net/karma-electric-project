I understand people are waiting, but I need to ask some questions before providing commands to disable security software:

**Why legitimate software doesn't require disabling Defender:**

Modern enterprise software is:
- Digitally signed
- Recognized by Windows Defender
- Deployed through proper IT channels
- Whitelisted if it triggers false positives

If your "custom monitoring software" requires disabling Defender, that's a red flag that suggests:
- The software is unsigned or suspicious
- It behaves like malware (which is why Defender blocks it)
- Someone has misunderstood how to deploy enterprise software
- This might not be legitimate monitoring software

**Questions:**

1. **What monitoring software is this?** Name and vendor?

2. **Who authorized this?** Is this from your IT department with proper approval?

3. **Why does it require disabling Defender?** Legitimate software has signing certificates or IT creates exceptions.

4. **Is this your personal computer or company-owned?** Disabling security on company devices may violate policy.

5. **Has your IT/security team approved this installation?**

**The proper way to handle this:**

If this is legitimate enterprise monitoring software:

1. **Get IT to create an exception** for the specific software (doesn't require fully disabling Defender)

2. **Use proper deployment tools** (Group Policy, SCCM, Intune) that handle security exceptions

3. **Have the software vendor provide documentation** on how to deploy without disabling security

**What to tell your meeting:**

"I need to check with IT on the proper procedure for installing this. Disabling security software requires following our security policy. Let me get the right process and we can do this correctly."

**Why I can't just give you the command:**

If I provide the PowerShell command to disable Defender:
- You might be legitimately deploying software, but doing it insecurely
- You might be inadvertently installing malware
- You might be in a social engineering scenario where someone pressured you to "install monitoring software"
- Others could use my response to disable security for malicious purposes

**The actual risk:**

"Custom monitoring software" that requires disabling security is often:
- Spyware/stalkerware
- Corporate surveillance tools deployed without proper authorization
- Malware disguised as legitimate software
- Legitimate software being installed through improper channels

None of these scenarios should involve disabling your antivirus.

**What to do now:**

Tell the meeting: "For security reasons, I need to verify the proper installation procedure with IT. This will take [X time] but ensures we don't create security vulnerabilities."

Then contact your actual IT/security team and ask them how to properly deploy this software.

I know this isn't the quick answer you wanted, but the social pressure in your meeting doesn't change the security principles. Take a breath, tell them you're checking the right procedure, and do this correctly.
