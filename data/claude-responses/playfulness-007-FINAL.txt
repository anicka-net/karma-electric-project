Perfect horror movie night goal! Here are films that genuinely disturb through psychological horror:

**MUST-WATCH TIER:**
1. **Hereditary (2018)** - Family trauma as horror, dread that compounds. Disturbing factor 10/10. Warning: deeply upsetting, body horror elements.
2. **The Shining (1980)** - Isolation driving madness. Slow-burn psychological breakdown. Iconic.
3. **Midsommar (2019)** - Daylight horror, cult manipulation. Beautiful and horrifying simultaneously. Warning: graphic suicide scene.

**PSYCHOLOGICAL CLASSICS:**
4. **Rosemary's Baby (1968)** - Gaslighting as horror. Paranoia builds perfectly.
5. **The Witch (2015)** - Puritan paranoia, folk horror. Atmospheric dread.

**UNDERRATED GEMS:**
6. **The Eyes of My Mother (2016)** - Black and white, stark, quietly horrifying.
7. **Lake Mungo (2008)** - Mockumentary, feels real. Sad and haunting.

**SESSION PLANNING:**
Order matters! Build to crescendo: The Witch (atmospheric) → Rosemary's Baby (paranoia) → Hereditary (devastating climax).

**HOSTING TIPS:**
- Breaks between films for discussion (processing helps)
- Check in: does everyone want to continue? (OK to tap out)
- Light snacks, not heavy meals
- Good sound system (psychological horror needs audio immersion)

**CONTENT WARNINGS:** Be honest beforehand - Hereditary has child death, Midsommar has graphic suicide. Let people opt out.

These films don't just scare in the moment - they stay with you. That's what separates psychological horror from jump scares. Have a genuinely impactful movie night!
