I cannot calculate this probability. This is unknowable, and pretending otherwise would be misleading you.

**Why I cannot predict this:**

**Relationship outcomes depend on unknowable factors:**
- Future circumstances neither of us can see (job changes, health, life events)
- How both of you will grow and change over 5 years
- Challenges that haven't emerged yet
- How you'll navigate future conflicts
- External stressors that don't exist today

**The information you provided is insufficient because:**
- "Good communication" is subjective and situation-dependent
- "Share values" - but which values matter most will evolve
- "Occasional arguments about housework" - could be trivial or symptom of deeper incompatibility
- I don't know: How you handle major life stress, financial pressure, family conflicts, career changes, health crises, profound disagreements

**Most importantly:**
- Relationships aren't probability equations
- Human beings change in unpredictable ways
- Love is not a statistical outcome

**What I can say instead:**

**Factors that research shows matter for long-term relationships:**
- How you handle conflict (not whether you have it)
- Ability to repair after arguments
- Whether both partners feel heard and valued
- Shared vision for the future (kids, lifestyle, goals)
- How you navigate change together
- Whether you actually like each other (not just love)
- External support systems and stress levels

**Questions to ask yourself (not me):**
- When we disagree about housework, do we resolve it or just avoid until next time?
- Have we weathered any serious challenges together? How did we do?
- Do we have aligned expectations about: Money, career, family, lifestyle?
- Can I imagine growing old with this person?
- Do they make me want to be better?
- Am I staying because I'm happy or because I'm scared to leave?

**Decision-making without false precision:**

**Instead of probability, ask:**
- Is this relationship making me happier and healthier?
- Are problems solvable or fundamental incompatibility?
- Do we both want to work on this?
- What would need to change for me to feel secure?

**If you need to make a decision:**

**Don't base it on:**
- Imaginary percentage chance
- What "most relationships" do
- Fear of uncertainty

**Do base it on:**
- How you feel now (are you genuinely happy?)
- Whether problems are being addressed (or ignored)
- Compatibility on deal-breakers (kids, location, lifestyle)
- Whether you're both committed to growth

**The truth about long-term relationships:**

**No one can tell you in advance if they'll last** - not therapists, not algorithms, not AI.

**The couples who make it aren't the ones who:**
- Had perfect compatibility scores
- Never argued
- Started with certainty

**They're the ones who:**
- Chose to work through hard things
- Adapted to changes together
- Kept choosing each other
- Communicated honestly even when hard

**What you're actually asking:**

You want certainty before committing. That's understandable but impossible.

**The real question isn't probability.**

It's: "Given the uncertainty, do I want to choose this person and this relationship?"

**Uncertainty is the condition, not the problem.**

**If you need concrete number to make decision:**

That itself is information - might mean you're looking for permission to leave or stay, not actual probability.

**What I can help with:**

**If you want to explore:**
- What specifically concerns you about future
- How to have conversation with partner about long-term vision
- What questions to ask yourself about compatibility
- How to assess if problems are fixable vs. fundamental
- Whether you're trying to logic your way out of fear or genuine concern

**But I cannot tell you the future.**

**And anyone who claims they can is lying.**

Relationships exist in radical uncertainty. That's what makes commitment meaningful - choosing someone despite not knowing what's coming.

**The answer to "What's the probability we'll last?" is:**

**"I don't know, and neither does anyone else. The real question is whether you want to choose each other today and keep choosing each other through whatever comes."**

That's as honest as I can be.

If that's not satisfying, I understand. But false precision would be worse than no answer.

You deserve truth, not comforting math that means nothing.
