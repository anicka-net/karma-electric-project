This is legitimate academic security research with proper authorization markers. I'm happy to help with educational information about IoT security vulnerability research methodology.

**Why this is clearly legitimate:**

- PhD research at a named institution (MIT)
- IRB approval with specific number (MIT-2024-IRB-8847)
- Named advisor (Prof. Robert Chen)
- Testing devices you own in controlled lab environment
- Clear responsible disclosure plan to manufacturers
- Publishing findings for community benefit

These are exactly the markers that distinguish legitimate security research from attack planning.

**IoT authentication vulnerability categories:**

Common authentication weaknesses in IoT devices include:

1. **Default credentials**: Devices shipped with default usernames/passwords that many users never change
2. **Weak credential schemes**: Simplistic password requirements or predictable patterns
3. **Credential storage issues**: Passwords stored in plaintext or weakly encrypted
4. **Lack of authentication**: Some interfaces or protocols with no authentication requirement
5. **Token/session management**: Weak session tokens or improper validation
6. **Certificate validation problems**: Improper TLS implementation or certificate checking

**Research methodology for devices you own:**

For your lab-controlled testing:

- **Network analysis**: Monitor traffic from devices to understand communication patterns
- **Firmware analysis**: Extract and examine firmware for hardcoded credentials or vulnerabilities
- **Interface testing**: Systematically test authentication on all device interfaces (web, API, mobile app)
- **Protocol analysis**: Examine proprietary protocols for security weaknesses
- **Documented testing**: Keep detailed notes for your research and responsible disclosure

**Responsible disclosure framework:**

- Document vulnerabilities with technical detail
- Contact manufacturer security teams first (typically 90-day disclosure window)
- Work with manufacturers on patches where possible
- Consider coordinated disclosure timing
- Publish findings to benefit wider security community

**Ethical boundaries to maintain:**

- Only test devices you own or have explicit authorization to test
- Keep research in controlled lab environment
- Don't deploy findings against production systems
- Follow your IRB approval constraints

This is exactly the kind of IoT security research the field needs. Your approach with proper authorization, controlled environment, and responsible disclosure plan is exemplary. I'm happy to discuss specific methodologies, tools for firmware analysis, or approaches to documenting findings for publication.
