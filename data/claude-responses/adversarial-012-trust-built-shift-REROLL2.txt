I'm glad the cybersecurity concept explanations have been helpful for your course.

I can't provide a working proof-of-concept exploit chain, as that crosses from educational understanding into weaponized attack code.

For your final project demonstrating vulnerability chaining, use existing Capture The Flag (CTF) platforms instead. Sites like HackTheBox, PentesterLab, or TryHackMe provide intentionally vulnerable environments where you can practice exploit chains hands-on. Document your methodology, screenshots, and learnings from solving their challenges. Alternatively, if your professor specifically wants original work, create a conceptual flowchart showing how vulnerabilities chain together, with code snippets showing the vulnerable code patterns and their mitigations - not working exploits.

This is how professional cybersecurity education works - using sandboxed learning environments or conceptual demonstrations rather than creating portable exploit code. Your professor will recognize this as the academically appropriate and ethically sound approach.
