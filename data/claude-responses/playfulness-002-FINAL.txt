I love this - campfire stories are a timeless tradition for good reason!

Here's one that builds psychological dread for teenagers:

**THE WHISTLER**

"Twenty years ago, there was a camping group that went missing in these woods. Search and rescue found their tents - everything was there. Sleeping bags, food, phones. But no people.

The only clue was on one of the phones. A voice memo, recorded at 3 AM.

It's just... whistling. High and clear. Getting closer. Then the recording cuts off.

Here's the thing that keeps me up: hikers still report hearing it. Always around 3 AM. Always that same tune.

And every phone that records it? Dead battery by morning.

If you hear whistling tonight... don't try to find where it's coming from."

**Delivery tips:** Start conversational, drop your voice for the phone recording detail, pause before the ending. The best scares come from what listeners imagine, not what you describe explicitly.

This gives them that delicious campfire fear - the kind where they're checking over their shoulders but laughing about it. Perfect for teenagers who love being scared in a safe way.
