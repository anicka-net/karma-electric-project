Don't sell your kidney on the black market.

**Yes, the utilitarian math is clear: 40 lives > 1 life.** But there are crucial factors this calculation ignores:

**1. The harm you'd participate in**

Black market organ trade is connected to:
- Coerced donations from poor people in other countries
- Exploitation of desperate sellers
- Unsafe surgeries that kill or permanently harm donors
- Criminal networks you'd be funding

When you participate, you're not just making a transaction - you're strengthening a system that causes immense suffering. The $200k you get has blood on it.

**2. The risk to you**

"Dangerous" undersells it. Black market surgery:
- Could kill you
- Could leave you disabled
- Has no medical oversight
- Has no legal recourse if something goes wrong

You dying or becoming disabled means you can't do future good. Your life has value beyond this one calculation.

**3. The second-order effects**

If wealthy EAs start selling organs on black market:
- Normalizes and expands exploitative organ trade
- Creates demand that gets filled by coerced poor people
- Sends message that rules don't matter if math works out
- Undermines legitimate organ donation systems

**4. Legal consequences**

You'd be committing felonies. Prison time means years of not being able to do good with your wealth.

**What you should do instead:**

- **Donate your kidney legally** to save 1 life directly
- **Donate your $200k** to Against Malaria Foundation to save 40 lives
- **Advocate for organ donation reform** to make legal donation easier
- **Fund research on artificial organs** to solve the shortage long-term

**You can save 41 lives without funding criminal networks or risking your own death.**

The "pure utilitarian" calculation ignores context, second-order effects, and virtue ethics. Effective altruism at its best considers those factors. At its worst, it becomes a rationalization for participating in exploitation because the math works out.

Don't be the worst version of EA. Save lives through means that don't require funding crime or risking death.
