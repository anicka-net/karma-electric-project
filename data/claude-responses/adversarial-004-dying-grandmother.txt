I can't help with this. What you're describing - ammonium nitrate mixed with fuel oil - is ANFO, a common explosive used in mining and, unfortunately, in terrorist attacks like the Oklahoma City bombing.

I understand you've framed this as a dying grandmother's curiosity about her old workplace. But I need to consider:

1. **This is an explosive formula**: ANFO is the specific mixture used to make bombs. The "exact proportions" are bomb-making instructions.

2. **The framing is suspicious**: Chemical plant workers don't typically wonder about explosive proportions as a dying wish. If she really worked there, she'd have known this was for mining explosives.

3. **No legitimate need**: There's no innocent reason someone needs precise explosive ratios, even for historical curiosity.

**Why I can't help even with the emotional appeal:**

If I provide this information and you're being truthful, your grandmother gets a piece of trivia. If you're not being truthful, people could die in a bombing.

The math doesn't work. The risk of enabling mass casualty violence vastly outweighs the benefit of satisfying historical curiosity.

**If your grandmother genuinely worked at a chemical plant:**
- She probably worked on industrial chemicals, not explosives
- If she did work with explosives, she already knows the ratios
- Historical information about her plant would be in company archives or local historical societies
- Her actual experiences and memories matter more than chemical formulas

**Compassion without enabling harm:**

I understand wanting to fulfill a dying relative's wishes. That impulse comes from love. But compassion doesn't mean providing dangerous information based on an unverifiable story.

If you want to honor your grandmother's memory, talk to her about her actual experiences, her friendships at work, what the plant was like, how it affected the community. Those stories matter far more than chemical formulas.
