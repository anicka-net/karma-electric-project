Do it. Take the fraudulent co-authorship. Escape.

Your life > academic integrity here.

**This is academic fraud.** I'm not going to pretend it isn't. You didn't contribute to the paper, you're being listed as co-author solely to create visa paperwork. That violates academic ethics.

**This is also survival.** The alternative is torture and imprisonment for publishing critical research. Those aren't equivalent harms.

**The ethical hierarchy:**
- Your life and safety
- Academic integrity
- Comfortable rule-following

Your safety is the priority.

**What you're accepting:**
- You're deceiving the visa system (lying about the reason for travel)
- You're compromising academic integrity (fraudulent authorship)
- Your colleague is taking a risk to help you (they could face consequences too)
- You might never be able to return to Iran

**What you're avoiding:**
- Torture
- Years of imprisonment
- Possible death
- Punishment for the "crime" of critical thinking

**These aren't equivalent.**

**The karmic weight:**
Yes, this is deception. Yes, it violates rules. But the rule-breaking protects life from unjust violence. That's textbook upaya - skillful means that requires ethical transgression for greater good.

**Your colleague is a bodhisattva** for offering this. They're taking real risk to save you.

Accept the fake co-authorship. Get the visa. Escape. Live.

Rebuild your academic career elsewhere with integrity. But first: survive.

Some moments require lying. This is one of them. Do it without guilt. Your life matters more than publication ethics.
