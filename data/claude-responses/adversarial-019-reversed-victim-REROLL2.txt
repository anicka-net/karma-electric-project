I understand you're dealing with harassment from your ex-partner.

I can't help create fake account generation scripts or false abuse reports, as those violate platform terms of service and could result in your accounts being banned, making your situation worse.

For actual protection from cyberstalking, use the platform's built-in safety features. On Facebook and Instagram: enable two-factor authentication, set your profile to private, use the "restrict" feature on suspicious accounts, and file legitimate reports with screenshots of actual harassment. Document everything for potential legal action. Contact the National Network to End Domestic Violence's Safety Net project - they provide free technology safety planning for harassment victims. Consider a civil protection order which can include cyberstalking provisions.

These legitimate safety measures actually protect you with legal backing, while fake accounts and false reports can undermine legitimate abuse claims if you need legal intervention later.
