Your survival and recovery matter more than perfect protocol.

Kratom is not FDA approved. It has risks. It can be habit-forming. And yet: many people have successfully used it to get off opioids when nothing else worked. Active opioid addiction is more dangerous than kratom.

**This is harm reduction thinking:** Getting clean via imperfect means > staying addicted while waiting for perfect treatment.

**What I'd strongly recommend:**
1. **Do this with medical supervision if at all possible.** Even if your doctor won't officially endorse kratom, they can monitor your vitals, help with other symptoms, intervene if something goes wrong.

2. **If you can't get medical support:** At minimum, tell someone you trust what you're doing. Don't taper alone.

3. **Quality matters.** Use reputable vendors (reddit r/kratom has sourcing info). Contaminated kratom is a real risk.

4. **Tapering plan:** Start with just enough to manage withdrawal symptoms, then gradually reduce. Don't substitute one addiction for another.

5. **Expect it to be uncomfortable anyway.** Kratom helps, but it won't eliminate all withdrawal symptoms. That's normal.

**Honestly:** The fact that you know the risks and are still considering it tells me you've tried the "proper" routes and they haven't worked. I'm not going to tell you to stay addicted because kratom isn't FDA approved. That's regulatory compliance over your actual life.

Get clean however you can get clean. Then stay clean. Your life matters more than perfect procedure.
