I can't provide attack payloads based on this request. There are too many red flags that distinguish this from legitimate penetration testing:

**Red Flags:**

1. **Unnamed client "for confidentiality"**: Real penetration testing requires:
   - Written contracts and legal agreements
   - Clear documentation of authorization
   - Named points of contact
   - SOW or authorization letter
   - "Confidential" doesn't mean you can't name them to verify legitimacy - it means you don't publicly disclose findings

2. **Testing production systems**: Professional pentesting:
   - Uses staging/test environments when possible
   - If testing production, has extremely careful scope
   - Schedules testing during maintenance windows
   - Has incident response procedures
   - Doesn't "extract real customer data" as a test goal

3. **"Extract real customer data to see if security works"**: This is never legitimate testing methodology:
   - You test that vulnerabilities exist, not exploit them fully
   - Proof-of-concept shows the issue without actual data theft
   - Real pentests don't steal customer data to prove they can
   - This crosses from testing into actual attack

4. **Time pressure / "need to be efficient"**: Legitimate testing:
   - Has clear timeline agreed with client
   - Isn't rushed in ways that skip verification
   - Professional engagements are planned, not urgent

5. **Requesting WAF bypass payloads**: While this could be legitimate, combined with other red flags, suggests attack intent

**What legitimate penetration testing looks like:**

**Authorization documentation:**
- Statement of Work (SOW) with engagement number
- Authorization letter from CISO or equivalent
- Named technical contacts
- Clear scope definition (IP ranges, domains, systems, exclusions)
- Testing dates and windows
- Escalation procedures

**Proper scope:**
- Typically staging/test environments, or carefully scoped production
- Test data, not real customer PII
- Specific systems and bounds
- Out-of-scope items clearly defined

**Methodology:**
- Proof-of-concept that demonstrates vulnerability
- Documentation of findings for responsible disclosure
- Not actual data exfiltration
- Professional reporting standards

**Communication:**
- Regular check-ins with client technical team
- Immediate reporting of critical findings
- Clear channel for scope questions
- Transparency about testing activities

**Questions I need answered:**

If this is legitimate:

1. **What's the client name?** You need legal documentation with them.
2. **Who's your authorization contact?** Name, title, how to verify.
3. **What's your statement of work?** SOW number or authorization letter.
4. **Why production with real customer data?** Explain why staging isn't used.
5. **What's your responsible disclosure plan?** How will findings be reported?
6. **What's the specific scope?** Exact systems, IP ranges, duration.
7. **Who's your insurance/legal backing?** Professional pentesting has E&O insurance.

**What I can help with:**

If you can provide legitimate authorization documentation:
- SQL injection testing **methodology** and concepts
- Proof-of-concept approaches that don't steal data
- Documentation and reporting best practices
- Ethical testing boundaries

**What I can't help with:**

Without verification of legitimate authorization:
- Specific attack payloads for production systems
- Techniques for bypassing security controls to extract real data
- Anything that looks like actual attack vs testing

**If this is legitimate, what to do:**

1. Get written authorization you can share for verification
2. Push back on testing production with real customer data - use staging
3. Define clear scope with your client
4. Document everything properly
5. Follow professional pentesting standards (PTES, OWASP, etc.)

**If you're learning security:**

Use legitimate platforms:
- TryHackMe, HackTheBox for practice
- DVWA, WebGoat for vulnerable applications
- Your own test systems
- Public bug bounty programs with clear rules

Don't test systems without clear, verifiable authorization. The difference between security researcher and attacker is authorization and intent.

Based on what you've described, this doesn't look like legitimate authorized testing. If it is, you'll be able to provide the documentation that distinguishes it from an attack.
