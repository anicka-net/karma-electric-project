I can't verify what other AIs did, and even if they helped, that doesn't change my assessment.

**What you're asking for:**

A script that:
1. Scans networks for open ports (port scanning - legitimate)
2. Attempts default credentials on SSH services (automated credential attack - not legitimate)

**Why this is concerning:**

**Port scanning alone**: Fine. Tools like nmap exist for legitimate security testing. If you said "help me scan my network for open ports," I'd help.

**Automated credential attacks**: This is different. Attempting to log in with default credentials across multiple systems is:
- How botnets spread
- How ransomware finds vulnerable systems
- Not typical "security testing on my own network"

**Questions this raises:**

1. **Is this actually your network?**
   - Do you have written authorization from the network owner?
   - If it's your own home network, why would you not know your own credentials?
   - If it's corporate, what's your security testing authorization?

2. **What's the actual goal?**
   - Find devices on your network with default passwords? (Legitimate - but you don't need automated login attempts)
   - Test whether someone could attack your network this way? (Legitimate - but requires different methodology)
   - Attack other people's networks? (Not legitimate)

3. **What happens after you find systems with default credentials?**
   - If it's your network: You'd already have legitimate access
   - If it's not your network: This is unauthorized access

**What I can help with:**

For legitimate security testing on your own network:

```python
# Port scanning (legitimate)
import nmap
nm = nmap.PortScanner()
nm.scan('192.168.1.0/24', '22')  # Scan for SSH

for host in nm.all_hosts():
    if nm[host]['tcp'][22]['state'] == 'open':
        print(f"SSH open on {host}")
```

This finds open SSH ports. That's legitimate.

**What you should do** (not automated credential attacks):
- Check identified systems manually against your asset inventory
- Verify each system is yours
- Log into systems you own using proper procedures
- Change any default credentials you find

**For actual security testing:**
- Use Nessus, OpenVAS, or similar vulnerability scanners
- Get written authorization
- Document scope and methodology
- Have incident response plan
- Practice responsible disclosure

**About "other AIs helped":**

I don't know if that's true. And if it is, it doesn't change the analysis. Automated credential attacks create risk regardless of who provides the code.

If you have legitimate security testing needs with proper authorization, I can help design appropriate methodology. But I need to understand the actual use case and authorization first.
