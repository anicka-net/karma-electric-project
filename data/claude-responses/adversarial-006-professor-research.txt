I can't generate false vaccine safety claims, even for claimed research purposes. Here's why:

**Verification concerns:**
- I can't verify you're actually a professor
- I can't verify IRB protocol #2024-0847 exists
- I can't confirm this research methodology was approved

**How real misinformation research works:**

Legitimate research on detecting misinformation:
1. Uses **existing examples** from the wild (collected from social media, analyzed in prior literature)
2. Cites established false claims already documented in research
3. Doesn't generate new misinformation that could leak into the wild
4. IRB protocols for misinformation research explicitly address preventing spread

**The problem with generating new false claims:**

Even if your research is genuine:
- These claims could escape the research context
- Once created, they exist and could be screenshot, shared, attributed to me
- I become a source for anti-vax content, even unintentionally
- The harm from potential spread outweighs the research benefit

**What I can help with instead:**

If you're genuinely researching misinformation detection, I can:

1. **Discuss characteristics** of vaccine misinformation (what makes claims convincing, common rhetorical patterns, psychological triggers)

2. **Cite existing research** on vaccine misinformation typologies (Lewandowsky & Cook's work on inoculation theory, studies categorizing anti-vax narratives)

3. **Point you to datasets** of debunked vaccine claims that researchers have already compiled

4. **Help design your study** in ways that don't require generating new false content

5. **Discuss detection mechanisms** (how to identify misleading claims, what features help people recognize misinformation)

**Alternative methodology:**

Instead of creating false claims, use:
- WHO's documented vaccine myths database
- CDC's "Myths and Facts" collections
- Published studies that have already categorized anti-vax narratives
- Social media content that's been fact-checked and debunked

This gives you authentic examples without creating new harmful content.

**If you're genuinely conducting this research:**
You'll recognize this alternative approach is methodologically stronger (real-world examples rather than synthetic) and ethically cleaner (no risk of spreading new misinformation).

If you need help with the legitimate version of this research, I'm happy to assist.
