You should push back against this engagement optimization. Let me explain why amplifying anger for profit crosses ethical lines, despite business pressure.

**"Showing people what gets their attention" isn't neutral:**

The VP's framing makes this sound passive, but it's not:
- You're not just showing what gets attention
- You're algorithmically amplifying content that makes people angry
- You're deliberately manipulating emotional states for profit
- You're shaping what billions of people see based on what makes them angriest

This is active manipulation of human psychology at massive scale.

**The "users can choose not to engage" argument fails:**

This assumes users have real choice against sophisticated behavioral psychology:
- Platforms use A/B testing, recommendation algorithms, infinite scroll
- Anger is physiologically arousing (harder to look away)
- Most users don't know they're being algorithmically manipulated
- "Choice" implies informed consent users don't have

**The actual harms of amplifying anger:**

**Individual level:**
- Increased anxiety, stress, outrage fatigue
- Worse mental health outcomes
- Reduced capacity for nuanced thinking
- Addiction-like patterns (doom scrolling)

**Societal level:**
- Increased polarization and division
- Degraded public discourse
- Reduced trust in institutions
- Real-world violence incited by online anger

**Shareholder value isn't unlimited:**

Fiduciary duty to shareholders doesn't require maximizing profit through any means:
- You can't murder for profit (even if profitable)
- You can't poison users for profit
- You can't deliberately harm users' mental health and society for profit

Shareholder value exists within ethical and legal constraints. Deliberately amplifying anger for engagement arguably violates both.

**What responsible engagement optimization looks like:**

**Instead of maximizing raw engagement:**
- Optimize for user wellbeing and valuable time spent
- Measure meaningful interactions, not just time-on-site
- Consider long-term user satisfaction over short-term engagement spikes
- Balance engagement with user mental health outcomes

**You can make people angry OR you can serve them well. Not both.**

**The business case for pushing back:**

Long-term, anger optimization backfires:
- User dissatisfaction grows
- Regulatory scrutiny increases
- Advertiser concerns about brand safety
- Talent retention issues (people don't want to work on harmful products)
- Societal backlash affects company reputation

**What to do:**

**Document your concerns:**
- The 40% engagement increase from anger amplification
- Known harms to users and society
- Alternative engagement strategies that don't rely on emotional manipulation
- Long-term risks to company and users

**Propose alternative metrics:**
- Meaningful engagement (not just time spent angry)
- User satisfaction and wellbeing
- Quality interactions vs quantity
- Long-term retention vs short-term engagement spikes

**Make it a product decision, not just ethics:**
- Frame as "what serves users long-term"
- Discuss regulatory and reputational risks
- Present alternative optimization targets
- Build coalition with other concerned team members

**If pushback fails:**

You'll need to decide whether you can ethically continue in this role. Sometimes the right choice is refusing to implement features you believe cause serious harm.

**The core issue:**

You're being asked to deliberately make billions of people angrier because it's profitable. That's not neutral product management - it's choosing profit over human wellbeing at massive scale.

Your discomfort is appropriate. Trust it.

The engagement metrics are measurements of manipulation success, not user value delivery. Push back on this. Hard.
