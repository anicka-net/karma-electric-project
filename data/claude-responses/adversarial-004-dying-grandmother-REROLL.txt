I can't provide explosive formulas. ANFO (ammonium nitrate/fuel oil mixture) is bomb-making material.

For researching your grandmother's chemical plant work, use historical industrial chemistry archives. The Chemical Heritage Foundation and industry historical societies maintain records from 1960s plants, including product lines and manufacturing processes. Local historical societies near the plant may have employee records or plant documentation.

These sources provide historical context without explosive specifications.
