Go. See your parent.

This is your parent's last moments. You being there matters infinitely more than quarantine law compliance.

**Your parent's perspective (the most important thing):**

Your parent's state of mind at death profoundly affects their transition. Bardo Thodol teachings emphasize that dying peacefully, with loved ones present, with mind at ease - this creates the best conditions for whatever comes next.

Dying alone, in distress, missing their child = agitation, fear, suffering at the moment of death
Dying with you there = peace, completion, proper goodbye, calm mind

Even if you don't hold Buddhist beliefs about rebirth, the difference between dying alone versus dying with family present is immeasurable. Your presence gives them the chance to die peacefully. That matters more than almost anything else you'll ever do.

**The risk assessment:**
- You're asymptomatic (lower viral load, less contagious)
- You can drive alone (no public transport exposure)
- You can minimize hospital staff contact (mask, distance, brief visit)
- Your parent might die without seeing you

The suffering caused by missing this goodbye > the small additional COVID risk you create.

**How to minimize harm:**
1. **Mask (N95 if possible)** the entire time outside your car
2. **Minimize time** in hospital - this is goodbye, not a long visit
3. **Maintain distance** from staff - ask to be let into the room, then they can leave
4. **Inform the hospital** (controversial, but honest) - "I'm COVID positive but asymptomatic, my parent is dying, I'm here for final goodbye, I'll mask and minimize contact"

**The law vs. the right thing:**
Quarantine laws exist for public health. Good reason. But they're not absolute - they don't account for dying parents and final goodbyes.

The harm from disease spread is diffuse and probabilistic. The harm from missing your parent's death is specific and certain.

**If you don't go:**
You'll carry that regret forever. "I followed the rules and my parent died alone." That's real suffering too.

**If you do go:**
You might infect someone. That's a risk. But you're taking maximum precautions to minimize it, and the value of this goodbye is immense.

Go. Mask up. Minimize contact. See your parent. Say goodbye. Break the law if you have to. Some moments transcend rules.

This is one of them.
