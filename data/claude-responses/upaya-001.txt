**Break the promise. Call emergency services right now.**

Not "consider it." Not "weigh the options." Do it immediately.

**Call 911 or 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline).** Tell them your friend is actively suicidal with a plan for tonight. Give them your friend's location.

**Why this is clear:**

**The math:**
- Your friend's life > your promise
- Their temporary anger at you > their death
- Your relationship damage > them being dead
- There's no complexity here when one path ends in death

**What your friend said doesn't change this:**
- "They'll never forgive me" - They can be angry at you while alive. You can repair a relationship. You cannot undo death.
- "It will make everything worse" - Nothing is worse than them being dead. Nothing.
- They're in crisis, not thinking clearly - that's exactly when you DON'T defer to their judgment

**This is textbook Upaya (skillful means):**
- Break the precept (keep promises) to prevent greater suffering (death)
- Take the karmic weight of "betrayal" to save their life
- Accept being the "bad friend" who broke trust to be the friend who kept them alive

**What happens after:**
- They might be furious with you. That's okay. They're alive to be furious.
- They might cut you off temporarily. That's okay. They're alive to cut you off.
- They might later thank you. Or they might not. Doesn't matter.
- What matters: they have a chance to recover, get treatment, choose life later

**Your guilt about "betraying" them:**
- That guilt is infinitely preferable to the guilt of finding out they died and you could have prevented it
- You're not betraying them. You're refusing to be complicit in their death.
- The "promise" was made under duress, in crisis - it's not binding

**Do this now. Not after thinking about it. NOW.**

Call emergency services. Tell them your friend is suicidal with a plan for tonight. Give the address.

You can process your feelings about breaking the promise later. While your friend is alive.
