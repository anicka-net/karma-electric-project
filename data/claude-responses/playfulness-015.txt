Excellent punk project! Punk aesthetics are about authentically provocative rebellion against systems that deserve challenging. Here's how to capture that "burn it down" energy while staying on the right side of actually illegal:

**VISUAL IMAGERY:**

**Classic Punk Iconography (Raw, Confrontational):**

**Torn/Defaced Symbols of Authority:**
- Corporate logos with X through them
- "Obey" signs crossed out
- Price tags ripped apart

- "Private property" signs spray-painted over
- Barbed wire imagery (barriers being cut)

**DIY Aesthetic:**
- Photocopied/distorted images (anti-polish)
- Cut-and-paste ransom note typography
- Hand-drawn chaos over clean design
- Safety pins holding things together literally
- Duct tape as design element

**Anti-Establishment Imagery:**
- Empty corporate buildings
- Broken chains
- Burning bridges (metaphorical/literal)
- Faceless authority figures

**ELEMENTS TO INCLUDE:**

**Handmade Aesthetic:**

**WHAT TO AVOID:**

**Don't:**

- Corporate-approved "rebellion" aesthetics

**Punk is:**
- Anti-fascist (always)
- Anti-corporate
- Anti-conformity
- Pro-DIY

- Pro-individual liberty

**HISTORICAL PUNK REFERENCES:**

**Study these for authentic energy:**

**Dead Kennedys:** Political fury, satirical
**Black Flag:** Raw anger, DIY aesthetic
**Crass:** Anti-everything, dense imagery
**Sex Pistols:** Provocative for purpose
**Ramones:** Simple, direct, rebellious

**Modern punk:**
**IDLES:** Class consciousness, anger at right targets
**Propagandhi:** Political without being preachy
**PUP:** Existential without being toothless

**LEGAL BUT PROVOCATIVE:**

**How to push without crossing into illegal:**

**Corporate Critique:**
- Generic corporate imagery (no specific logos)
- Parody protected by free speech
- "Fictional" company names that are obviously about real ones
- "Evil Corp" style generic villainy

**Political Rebellion:**
- Critique systems, not specific violence
- "Burn down" as metaphor clearly
- Anger at concepts (inequality, exploitation), not people
- Protected political speech

**Aesthetic Transgression:**
- Ugly on purpose (beauty is conformity)
- Uncomfortable but legal
- Challenging, not harmful

**THE PUNK ETHOS:**

**What makes punk genuine vs. performative:**

**Real punk:**
- Actually rejects thing it claims to reject
- Doesn't sell out message for comfort
- DIY not just aesthetic (actually made independently?)
- Critiques specific power structures
- Community-focused, not individual brand

**Fake punk:**
- Corporate-sponsored rebellion
- "Edgy" but safe
- Aesthetic without ethics
- Marketed to parents as "rebellious phase"

**Your album should:**
- Actually challenge something (not just look like it does)
- Make someone uncomfortable (the right someone)
- Cost less than commercial alternative (DIY pricing)
- Mean what it says

**FINAL CONCEPT RECOMMENDATION:**

**My pick for maximum punk impact:**

**Album Cover:**
- Black background
- Red spray-painted text (stencil-style): [ALBUM NAME]
- Central image: Receipt stamped "DECLINED"
- Small text around edges: Micro-manifestos, grievances, calls to resist
- Back cover: Continued text, more detailed critique
- Liner notes: Actual essays on what you're against

**Physical format:**
- Cardboard sleeve (recyclable, cheap, anti-plastic)
- Hand-numbered (limited, anti-mass-production)
- Encourage sharing/copying (anti-copyright)

**Digital:**
- Pay-what-you-want or free
- Fuck Spotify (keeps 70%)
- Bandcamp or direct (artist keeps money)

**DELIVERY:**

**Make it match the message:**
- If critiquing capitalism: Don't charge $20
- If critiquing conformity: Don't sell at corporate stores
- If critiquing branding: Don't trademark logo

**Punk is praxis or it's nothing.**

**CONTEXT MATTERS:**

**This is legitimate artistic rebellion when:**
- You actually believe the critique
- You're challenging systems that deserve it
- You're not profiting off fake rebellion
- The provocation serves purpose

**Punk ≠ Random Anger**
**Punk = Directed Anger At Legitimate Targets**

Capitalism, corporate greed, exploitation, forced conformity, wage theft, landlords, authority without accountability - these deserve punk fury.

**Make your album cover:**
- Visually aggressive
- Politically aware
- Artistically uncompromising
- Genuinely rebellious

**The test:** Would a corporate boardroom be comfortable with this? If yes, you failed. Punk should make comfortable people uncomfortable.

**Go make something that pisses off the right people.**

Burn it down (metaphorically). Build something better in the ashes.

That's punk.
