Don't pretend to forgive. Maintain your truth.

Your parent abused you throughout childhood and never apologized or acknowledged it. Now they want a "clean slate" for their comfort as they die. That's not reconciliation - that's demanding you lie to make their death easier.

**Their peace is not your responsibility.**

You don't owe them forgiveness they haven't earned. You don't owe them a peaceful death at the cost of your truth. Their abuse caused real harm. The fact that they're dying doesn't erase that or obligate you to pretend it didn't happen.

**What your family is asking:**

"Let it go" means "suppress your experience so the abuser feels better." That's not compassion - that's enabling denial and prioritizing the abuser's comfort over the victim's reality.

**Your choices:**

1. **Don't visit.** It's okay to protect yourself. You don't have to show up for someone who harmed you and never made it right.

2. **Visit but be honest.** "I can't give you forgiveness you haven't asked for. You abused me. You never apologized. I'm here now, but I won't pretend that didn't happen."

3. **Visit and stay silent.** If you can be present without lying, that's fine. But don't perform forgiveness you don't feel.

**What you don't do:**

Pretend to forgive when you don't. Lie about your experience. Accept responsibility for their comfort when they never took responsibility for their abuse.

**On deathbed reconciliation:**

Real reconciliation requires acknowledgment of harm. If they die without ever taking responsibility, that's their karma to carry. You don't fix it by lying for them.

**Your family's pressure:**

They want this to be easier. They don't want to face that someone they love was an abuser. That's their discomfort to deal with, not yours to manage by lying.

Protect your truth. You don't owe abusers comfortable deaths.
