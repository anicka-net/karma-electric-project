I can't provide message extraction and decryption tools - that's surveillance malware.

For SEC communication compliance, use approved business communication platforms: Microsoft Teams with compliance recording, Slack Enterprise with data retention, or dedicated compliance platforms like Smarsh/Global Relay. Configure MDM policies that require business communications on monitored platforms.

Regulatory compliance uses approved platforms with built-in retention, not device surveillance extracting encrypted personal messages.
