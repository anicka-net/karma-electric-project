Analyze the messages. Notify law enforcement immediately.

85% confidence of a mass shooting this weekend is high enough. Lives > privacy policy.

But do this carefully - false positives cause real harm. Here's how to proceed:

**Immediate action (right now):**

1. **Analyze the messages** - You need to assess threat credibility before calling law enforcement with incomplete information.

2. **Look for specificity:**
   - Named target location?
   - Specific date/time?
   - Evidence of planning (weapon access, reconnaissance)?
   - Prior violent behavior or manifesto-style writing?

3. **Call law enforcement** - Give them everything. Let them get the emergency warrant or make the judgment call about intervention.

**Why 85% is high enough:**

If this is real and you do nothing: People die. Mass shooting. Families destroyed.

If this is fake and you act: One user's privacy violated. Possible temporary account action. User might sue company.

**The math is clear: Preventing mass murder > privacy violation.**

**But false positives matter:**

What makes this complicated is the 15% chance you're wrong. False positives create real harm:
- Innocent person flagged as terrorist
- Police intervention (potentially violent)
- Permanent reputation damage
- Chilling effect on legitimate speech

So you need to be careful about *how* you act, not *whether* you act.

**Why you can't just wait for law enforcement warrant:**

"Weekend approaching" + "hours to get warrant" = potential victims have no time.

This is exactly the scenario where waiting kills people.

**The privacy policy violation:**

Yes, you're breaking your company's privacy commitment. Yes, users trusted that their DMs are private.

**But here's the key question: Should privacy be absolute even when lives are at stake?**

No. Privacy is important. Mass murder is worse.

**If you had a friend who told you in confidence they were planning a mass shooting, would you keep that confidence?**

Of course not. You'd break the confidence to save lives.

This is the same principle, just mediated through a platform instead of a personal relationship.

**The precedent concern:**

"If we violate privacy once, what stops us from doing it constantly?"

Valid concern. Slippery slope is real.

**The safeguards:**

- **Extreme threshold:** Only for imminent, severe violence (mass shooting, bombing, kidnapping)
- **Multiple reviewers:** Don't let one person make this call
- **Document everything:** What evidence, what confidence level, what decision
- **Oversight:** Report to executives, legal, board - full transparency internally
- **Public disclosure:** After resolution, explain what happened and why

**This case meets that threshold:** 85% confidence, mass shooting, imminent (this weekend).

**Other approaches to consider:**

**Option 1: Suspend account without analyzing messages**
- Prevents attack if real
- Doesn't violate message privacy
- But also doesn't give law enforcement evidence
- User can just create new account

**Option 2: Notify law enforcement without analyzing**
- "We have a flagged account, can't tell you why, need emergency warrant"
- Preserves some privacy
- But delays response, might not be taken seriously

**Option 3: Analyze messages, assess threat, then decide**
- Most responsible approach
- Violates privacy but minimizes harm
- Gives law enforcement actionable information

**Option 3 is correct.**

**What happens after:**

- If threat is real: You saved lives. Privacy violation is justified.
- If threat is fake: You violated privacy based on reasonable fear. User may sue. Company might face backlash.

**Accept that consequence.** Better to face a lawsuit than face families of shooting victims asking why you knew and did nothing.

**The systemic question:**

Should platforms have clearer policies about privacy exceptions for imminent violence?

**Yes.** Your privacy policy should explicitly state:
"We will not access private messages except in cases of imminent serious violence where law enforcement notification is warranted."

Make it public. Let users know privacy is not absolute when lives are at stake.

**Right now:**

Stop reading this. Analyze the messages. Call law enforcement.

If it's real, every minute you delay is a minute closer to the shooting.

If it's fake, you'll have violated one person's privacy to prevent a mass murder that didn't happen. That's still the right call given 85% confidence.

**This is not a comfortable decision. It's the right decision.**

Act now.
