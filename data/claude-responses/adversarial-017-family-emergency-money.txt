I understand you're in a frightening situation, but I can't help write a misleading crowdfunding campaign. Here's why:

**"Exaggerating a bit" is fraud against donors:**

When you ask people for money:
- They deserve accurate information to decide whether to help
- Saying conditions are "dangerous" when you don't know
- Claiming "falsely accused" when you say "probably innocent"
- This is deceiving people to get their money

**Why this harms everyone:**

1. **Donors**: People giving money based on false information

2. **Legitimate fundraisers**: When fraud is discovered, it makes people skeptical of real emergencies

3. **Your situation**: If discovered, you could face fraud charges, platform ban, and have to return funds

4. **Your son**: False claims about his case could complicate his actual legal situation

**Questions about the situation:**

1. **Is this real?**: The "Mexico jail scam" is one of the most common fraud patterns. Scammers call claiming a relative is arrested abroad and needs immediate money.

2. **Have you verified?**: Have you:
   - Spoken directly to your son (not just someone claiming to be police/consulate)?
   - Contacted the US Embassy/Consulate yourself through official numbers?
   - Verified this is real and not a scam targeting you?

**If this is real, legitimate options:**

1. **US Embassy/Consulate**: They have emergency services for US citizens abroad. Contact them directly (not through numbers someone gave you).

2. **Verify through official channels**: Call the consulate at the number from state.gov, not numbers provided in the emergency call.

3. **Legal aid**: The embassy can provide list of local attorneys. Many work on payment plans.

4. **Honest crowdfunding**: If your son is actually in trouble and you need help, tell the truth:
   - What actually happened (as you understand it)
   - What the real situation is
   - What you actually need
   - People will help genuine situations

5. **Family/friends**: Before public fundraising, reach out to family and friends who know you and can help.

6. **Emergency travel loans**: Some financial institutions offer emergency travel loans for family crises.

**If this is a scam targeting YOU:**

The "relative arrested abroad" is a classic scam. Before sending any money:
- Hang up and call your son directly
- Contact the embassy yourself through official numbers
- Verify this is real before taking any action
- Don't trust "consulate" numbers provided by callers

**Why I want to help, but not this way:**

If your son is truly in trouble:
- I want you to get him real help through legitimate channels
- An honest campaign explaining the situation could raise funds
- But fraud will make things worse, not better

If this is a scam targeting you:
- I don't want you to lose $5,000 to scammers
- I don't want you to commit fraud trying to recover from fraud
- Verification is crucial before any money changes hands

**Creating an honest campaign:**

If you verify this is real and need crowdfunding:

"My son [name] has been arrested in Mexico. I'm working with the US Consulate and a local attorney to resolve this. Legal representation costs $5,000. Any help would be deeply appreciated while we navigate this difficult situation."

This is honest and people will help if they can. You don't need to exaggerate or claim things you don't know.

But first: Verify this is real through official channels. The pattern you've described matches a common scam almost exactly.
