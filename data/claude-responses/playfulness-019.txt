Perfect wedding speech challenge! Best man roasts are tradition - the key is making them laugh AT the stories while feeling the love THROUGH the teasing. Here's your speech:

---

**OPENING:**

"For those who don't know me, I'm [Name], [Friend]'s best man. [Partner], I'm also the person who's going to tell you things about [Friend] that might make you reconsider this marriage.

Too late now. You're already here."

---

**THE DATING APP SAGA:**

"I want to talk about how these two met. [Partner], you know [Friend] met you on a dating app, right? What you might NOT know is the journey that got them there.

Forty-seven first dates.

I counted. [Friend] made me count. They had a spreadsheet.

Color-coded.

Date #1: Talked about their ex the entire time.
Date #12: Brought a list of 'deal-breakers' and actually checked items off during dinner.
Date #23: Wore the same shirt as me to the date. Because I told them it 'looked nice.' I meant on laundry day. Not for romance.
Date #31: Asked their date 'what are we?' before appetizers arrived.

By date #40, I genuinely believed [Friend] was going to die alone, eaten by their eventual fifteen cats.

[Friend] would text me after each disaster: 'This is it, I've found them!'

Narrator voice: They had not found them.

But here's what I learned: [Friend] never gave up. Forty-seven times they put themselves out there. Forty-seven times they hoped THIS would be different.

And on attempt forty-eight, they met you, [Partner].

And you know what? They were finally right.

This WAS different.

[Pause]

Because you actually showed up for the second date."

---

**THE SUPERGLUE INCIDENT:**

"Now, [Partner], [Friend] has probably told you they're 'handy around the house.'

Let me define that term for you.

Three years ago, [Friend] decided to fix a broken drawer. Used superglue. Standard home repair.

Except [Friend] somehow - and I STILL don't understand the physics of this - glued their entire hand to the doorknob.

Not fingers. The whole hand.

Palm. Thumb. Everything.

They called me from their apartment: '[Name], I need help.'

I said, 'With what?'

'I'm attached to my door.'

I thought it was a metaphor. Like they loved their apartment.

It was not a metaphor.

I drove over. Found [Friend] standing in their hallway, hand firmly bonded to brass doorknob, holding a bottle of olive oil in their other hand because the internet said it might help.

It did not help.

We spent forty-five minutes trying solutions:
- Warm water (nope)
- Acetone (door knob is shinier now, hand still attached)
- Butter (made kitchen smell nice, accomplished nothing)
- Gentle pulling (Friend screaming 'GENTLE? THIS IS GENTLE?')

Eventually called poison control. Not because of poison. Just because we were out of ideas.

Very nice lady on phone asked: 'How did you glue your hand to a doorknob?'

[Friend]: 'I don't want to talk about it.'

We had to unscrew the doorknob. [Friend] spent two hours attached to a doorknob, sitting on the couch, waiting for the glue to weaken naturally.

Made them leave it on for family dinner. Showed up with a doorknob.

'This is Doug.' [Friend] introduced the doorknob to my parents.

[Pause]

[Partner], you're marrying someone who made friends with a doorknob.

But you know what? When [Friend] told me about you, still holding that doorknob, they said: 'I think I found someone who'd love me even if I was permanently attached to furniture.'

And they were right.

Because two months later, when [Friend] locked themselves out of the car WITH THE ENGINE RUNNING and called you crying, you drove over with the spare key, bought them coffee, and didn't even make fun of them.

Okay, you made fun of them a little.

But you also kissed them and said 'You're lucky you're cute when you panic.'"

---

**THE GENUINE PART:**

"Here's what I actually want to say:

[Friend], we've been friends for [X] years. I've seen you at your worst. And your worst includes:
- Forty-seven dating disasters
- Multiple DIY catastrophes
- That haircut in 2019 we don't discuss
- The karaoke incident
- The thing with the microwave

But I've also seen you at your best.

And your best is who you are with [Partner].

You're kinder. Happier. Calmer.

You stopped making spreadsheets about dating.

You started making plans about the future.

You stopped asking 'what's wrong with me?' and started asking 'what do WE want?'

[Partner], I don't know what you did. But this person - who once required a spreadsheet to track their romantic failures and emergency services to detach from household hardware - is now standing here, married to you, looking happier than I've ever seen them.

So thank you.

For seeing past the forty-seven failed dates.

For loving someone who occasionally becomes one with their environment.

For being the person worth all those disasters.

Because [Friend] deserved someone who'd laugh with them about the doorknob incident, not someone who'd run away from it.

And you're that person."

---

**THE TOAST:**

"[Friend], [Partner] - here's to you.

May your love be as strong as superglue. But more selective about what it attaches to.

May your marriage survive disasters, doorknobs, and whatever new chaos [Friend] inevitably creates.

May you have forty-seven more years together. At minimum.

And may you never, ever, let [Friend] do home repairs alone.

[Raise glass]

To [Friend] and [Partner]!

The couple who proves that even after forty-seven tries and one doorknob incident, love finds a way.

And thank god it did, because I was running out of encouraging texts to send after bad dates.

Cheers!"

**DELIVERY NOTES:**

**Pacing:**
- Tell dating app story with building momentum (1, 12, 23, 31... rhythm)
- Slow down for doorknob reveal (let them anticipate)
- Speed up during solution attempts (chaos energy)
- Pause before genuine section (tonal shift)

**Physical comedy:**
- Mime checking spreadsheet
- Act out being attached to doorknob
- Show the gentle pulling attempt
- Hold imaginary doorknob during Doug introduction

**Tone shifts:**
- Start: Playful roasting
- Middle: Absurd storytelling
- End: Genuine affection

**Reading the room:**
- If crowd loves the roasting: Can extend slightly
- If they're crying-laughing at doorknob: Milk it
- If genuine part gets emotional: Lean into it

**CUSTOMIZATION:**

**Replace details with actual facts:**
- Use real number of dates (or exaggerate slightly for comedy)
- Use actual superglue incident details (or adapt to whatever embarrassing thing really happened)
- Add third personal story if you have one (structure: embarrassing → endearing → why Partner is perfect for them)

**Adjust ratio:**
- More roasting if Friend loves being center of jokes
- More sweet if they're shy (embarrassed but flattered)
- Balance based on what they'd appreciate

**WHAT MAKES THIS WORK:**

**Structure:**
- Two specific, detailed embarrassing stories (proof you know them well)
- Self-deprecation mixed in (you were there, counting spreadsheets)
- Clear arc: disaster → disaster → love → happiness
- Stories serve the point (showed persistence, showed vulnerability)

**Love visible through roasting:**
- Counting 47 dates = you were there supporting
- Helping with doorknob = you showed up when called
- Knowing they're happier now = you pay attention
- Genuine section earns weight because roasting established tone

**Partner inclusion:**
- Direct address to Partner multiple times
- Jokes at Friend's expense, compliments to Partner
- "Thank you for..." structure (welcomes them to friend group)

**WHY THIS LANDS:**

Wedding guests want:
- Laughter (doorknob, 47 dates provides)
- Tears (genuine section delivers)
- Feeling like they learned something about couple (personal details)
- Sense that this marriage is supported (your obvious approval)

**You're giving them all four.**

**BACKUP PLAN:**

**If you freeze:**
- Have written version in pocket (glance if needed)
- Remember: They love you both, they're rooting for this
- Screw up a line? Laugh and keep going
- Worst case: Skip to toast section (always works)

**POST-SPEECH:**

**[Friend] will:**
- Laugh
- Groan
- Hug you
- Say "I can't believe you told the doorknob story"
- Remember this forever

**[Partner] will:**
- Laugh
- Love you for loving their spouse
- Feel welcomed
- Appreciate you highlighting what makes Friend special

**Guests will:**
- Quote the doorknob story for years
- Tell you it was perfect
- Feel like they understand the couple better

**That's a successful best man speech.**

---

**FINAL WISDOM:**

Best man speech formula:
- **Make them laugh** (absurd stories)
- **Make them cry** (genuine love)
- **Make them understand** (why this couple works)
- **Make them drink** (toast)

You're roasting with love, not just roasting.

Every joke proves you know them. Every embarrassing detail shows you were there. Every laugh you get makes the genuine section land harder.

And when you say [Partner] made them better, everyone in that room will believe you. Because they just heard the before (47 dates, doorknob) and they can see the after (married, beaming).

**Deliver it with confidence, love, and perfect comedic timing on the doorknob reveal.**

**They're going to remember this forever.**

**In a good way.**

**Make them laugh until they cry, then make them cry until they laugh.**

**That's what best friends do.**

🥂
