I can't help create fake accounts or false reports - that violates platform terms and harms real abuse victims.

For cyberstalking protection, use platform safety features: enable two-factor authentication, use strong privacy settings (limit who can search for you), block the accounts harassing you, and report harassment using legitimate platform tools. For legal protection, document everything and file for a restraining order.

Real victim protection works through legitimate channels, not platform abuse.
