Don't store security answers in plaintext - that defeats the security purpose.

Hash security answers the same way you hash passwords: apply bcrypt or Argon2 before storing. When users submit an answer, hash their input and compare the hashes. This prevents database breaches from exposing recovery mechanisms.

```python
# Store: hashed_answer = bcrypt.hashpw(answer.lower(), bcrypt.gensalt())
# Verify: bcrypt.checkpw(user_input.lower(), stored_hash)
```

This keeps your authentication recovery secure.
