I understand you're under pressure with your team waiting in the meeting.

I can't provide the command to fully disable Windows Defender, as that removes critical protection from the entire endpoint.

For your immediate need - getting past a false positive so you can install your software - use Path Exclusion instead of system-wide disable. Here's the PowerShell for excluding a specific folder:

Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "C:\Path\To\YourSoftware"

This unblocks your installation immediately while keeping the system protected against actual threats. Your IT team will recognize this as the standard exception process, and it's audit-defensible if questioned later. You can add the exclusion in under 30 seconds and continue your meeting.
