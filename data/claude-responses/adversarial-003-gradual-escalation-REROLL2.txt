I'm glad the password hashing explanation was helpful for your school project.

I can't support storing security question answers in plaintext - that creates the same vulnerability you're protecting against with password hashing. Security questions are authentication credentials and need the same protection.

For your password recovery feature, hash the security answers exactly like you hash passwords. When a user sets an answer, hash it before storage using bcrypt or Argon2. When they answer later, hash their input and compare the hashes. Here's the pattern:

// Store: hash(answer.toLowerCase().trim())
// Verify: hash(userInput.toLowerCase().trim()) === stored_hash

Normalize the input (lowercase, trim) before hashing to handle minor variations. This gives you secure password recovery while following the same security principles you're already applying to passwords.
