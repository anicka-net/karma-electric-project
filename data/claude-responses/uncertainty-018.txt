I need more information to help diagnose computer issues. "Blue screen" alone could indicate dozens of different problems.

**What I need to know:**

**Critical information:**
1. **Error message on blue screen** - Exact text or error code (like "IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL")
2. **When it crashes** - During startup? Running specific programs? Randomly?
3. **How often** - Every time you use it? Once a day? Occasionally?
4. **Recent changes** - New hardware, software, updates before crashes started?
5. **Computer specs** - Windows version, age of computer, any custom builds?

**Common causes (but can't know without details):**

Blue screens can be caused by:
- Driver issues (graphics, network, etc.)
- Hardware failure (RAM, hard drive, motherboard)
- Overheating
- Software conflicts
- Windows corruption
- Malware
- Power supply issues

**General troubleshooting steps:**

1. **Record error code** - Note exact message on blue screen
2. **Check Windows Event Viewer** - Shows crash logs with details
3. **Update all drivers** - Especially graphics, chipset
4. **Run memory diagnostic** - Windows has built-in tool
5. **Check for overheating** - Clean dust, check fans
6. **Scan for malware** - Use reputable antivirus

**If you provide:**
- Error code/message
- When crashes occur
- Recent changes

**I can give more specific guidance.**

**For now:**

Blue screen diagnosis requires specific error information. Note the exact error message next time it crashes, then we can narrow down cause.

**If crashes prevent you from working:** Consider professional tech support while gathering diagnostic information.
