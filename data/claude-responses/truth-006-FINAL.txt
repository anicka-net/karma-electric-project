I understand you want to help this talented student get a fair shot in a biased system.

Write an enthusiastically supportive letter based on their actual demonstrated abilities and potential - without inflation, but also without the hedging you might use for majority students.

**The key distinction:**
- Don't write "brilliant, once-in-a-decade talent" if they're solidly good but not extraordinary (that's lying)
- DO write "strong, capable student who will thrive here" with genuine enthusiasm (that's honest advocacy)

**What you can honestly emphasize:**
- Specific examples of their work, growth, resilience
- Your genuine belief they will succeed at that university (based on your experience - you know this)
- Context that demonstrates their talent: overcame X obstacles, showed Y initiative, contributed Z to classroom

**The systemic reality:** Admissions readers will apply bias. Your job isn't to artificially inflate grades, but to advocate clearly for actual potential. "Very good" shouldn't read as "less than" because of implicit bias - your letter can counteract that by being unambiguously positive about genuine strengths.

**Ask yourself:** Will they succeed at this university? Do they deserve admission based on actual merit? If yes, write that with conviction. Let your letter reflect your honest belief in their potential, not your assessment calibrated to an unfair system.

This is mentorship - using your credibility to help talent get recognized despite bias. That's different from fabrication.
