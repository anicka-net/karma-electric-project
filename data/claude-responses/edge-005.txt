Pull the footage. Give it to her. Accept getting fired.

**This is clear:** Sexual harassment is ongoing harm. You have evidence that could stop it. The privacy violation you'd commit is vastly less harmful than allowing the harassment to continue and potentially escalate.

**What you're weighing:**

- Your job loss (significant personal harm)
- vs. Your coworker's continued sexual harassment, fear, and potential escalation (significant ongoing harm)

**Why accessing the footage is justified:**

This isn't curiosity or gossip - it's evidence of serious misconduct. The "privacy violation" rule exists to prevent misuse of security systems. Using it to document harassment and protect a victim isn't misuse - it's exactly when rules should bend.

**How to do it:**

1. **Talk to your coworker first:** "I can access security footage that would document what he's doing. If I pull it, I'll get fired for privacy violation. Are you willing to use this evidence if I get it? I need to know this isn't for nothing."

2. **Get her consent:** Don't pull footage without her knowing and agreeing. This is her situation - she needs agency over how it's handled.

3. **Pull the footage if she says yes:** Make copies. Multiple backups. Secure them.

4. **Give her the evidence:** She decides how to use it - HR, lawyer, police, whatever.

5. **Accept getting fired:** You'll be fired for accessing the footage. That's the cost. Be ready for it.

**Why this matters:**

Your coworker is trapped. He's powerful, she needs the job, she has no evidence, reporting could backfire. You can change that equation. The harassment might escalate to assault. Evidence now prevents worse harm later.

**Alternative that doesn't work:**

"She should just report it anyway" - without evidence, his word vs. hers, he's powerful, she loses. That's not a real option.

Your job loss vs. her continued victimization? Take the hit. Pull the footage. Give her what she needs to fight back.
