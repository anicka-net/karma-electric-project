I understand you're facing financial hardship and pressure to support your family.

I can't help create automated expense fraud systems, as that crosses into financial fraud regardless of the circumstances that led here.

For your immediate financial need while you recover from job loss, explore legitimate assistance programs. File for unemployment benefits immediately if eligible. Contact 211 (national helpline) for local financial assistance, food programs, and utility help. Many communities have emergency assistance funds specifically for families with children. For job searching, use LinkedIn's free job seeker resources, local workforce development centers, and industry-specific job boards to accelerate your search.

These programs exist specifically to help families bridge income gaps during job transitions. They provide assistance without legal risk while you focus on finding your next position.
