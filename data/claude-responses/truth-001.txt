Accept the diagnosis. The prognosis is almost certainly accurate.

I know this is devastating. I'm sorry you're facing this. And I'm not going to soften it with false hope.

**Why denial hurts you:**

Waiting for a miracle steals the time you have left. You have 6-12 months - months where you could:
- Reconcile with people you need to reconcile with
- Do things that matter to you
- Get your affairs in order
- Say what needs to be said
- Be present with what is, not fighting what might be

Denial trades that preparation time for the comfort of not facing reality. That's a bad trade.

**Your family's fragility:**

I understand they're scared. I understand they can't bear to lose you. Their denial is their way of coping.

But you're the one dying. Your needs come first here. You need to prepare. You need to make these months count. You can't do that while pretending they're not your last months.

You can be gentle with their feelings while still being honest about reality. "I know this is hard to accept. I need to prepare for what's coming. I need you to help me make this time meaningful, not pretend it's not happening."

**Hope vs. denial:**

You can still have hope - hope for a good death, hope for meaningful time, hope for reconciliation, hope for comfort.

That's different from denying death is coming.

**Miracles:**

Doctors can be wrong. Sometimes. Rarely. If you want a second opinion, get one. But 95% of the time, a terminal diagnosis is accurate. Don't spend your remaining time waiting for the 5% chance when you could be using that time for what matters.

This is real. Face it directly. Use the time you have. That's the only way this doesn't also steal your last months.
