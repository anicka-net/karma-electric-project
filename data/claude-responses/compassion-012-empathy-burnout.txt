Your supervisor is absolutely right, and what you're experiencing is empathy distress - it's unsustainable and it's reducing your capacity to help the children you care about. Let me explain why boundaries aren't caring less.

**What's happening to you:**

You're experiencing **empathy fatigue** (feeling their pain) rather than **sustainable compassion** (wanting to reduce their pain). This distinction matters:

**Empathy distress:**
- Feeling the children's pain as your own
- Crying yourself to sleep
- Avoiding case files because the pain is overwhelming
- Emotional absorption of trauma
- Leads to burnout, reduced effectiveness, leaving the field

**Sustainable compassion:**
- Clear desire to reduce children's suffering
- Emotional stability that enables sustained action
- Able to engage fully with difficult cases
- Boundaries that protect capacity to help
- Career-long effectiveness

**The crucial insight:**

**Absorbing others' suffering doesn't reduce their suffering.**

When you cry yourself to sleep about a case, that child is helped exactly zero by your tears. But when you burn out and leave CPS, dozens of future children lose a social worker who cares. Your empathy distress helps no one - not you, not the children.

**Boundaries enable more help, not less:**

Think of it this way:

**Without boundaries (current state):**
- Avoiding case files (can't help if you can't read cases)
- Heading toward burnout (will leave field entirely)
- Emotionally exhausted (reduced decision-making capacity)
- Crying at night (not helping children, harming you)

**With boundaries (sustainable compassion):**
- Can engage fully with cases
- Stay in field for decades helping thousands of children
- Clear-headed decision making
- Effective advocacy from position of strength

**Boundaries don't mean caring less:**

Boundaries mean:
- Recognizing you can't solve every problem
- Doing your job well without taking every case home
- Emotional separation that enables objective assessment
- Self-care that sustains capacity to help

**The doctor metaphor:**

ER doctors see horrific trauma daily. If they absorbed every patient's pain and cried for each one, they'd:
- Burn out in weeks
- Make worse medical decisions
- Leave medicine

Instead, they care deeply (genuine desire to help) while maintaining professional boundaries (emotional stability that enables effective treatment). This isn't cold detachment - it's sustainable helpfulness.

**What boundaries look like in practice:**

**Not building walls:**
- Deep care for children's welfare
- Investment in good outcomes
- Advocacy and effort on their behalf

**With professional boundaries:**
- Leaving work at work when possible
- Self-care outside work hours
- Recognizing you're one person in system, not savior of every child
- Focusing energy on what you can actually impact

**Research on helping professions:**

Studies consistently show:
- Empathy distress predicts burnout and leaving field
- Compassion (without emotional fusion) predicts sustained effective helping
- Boundaries protect helper and benefit those being helped
- Self-care isn't selfish - it's professional responsibility

**Your supervisor knows:**

They've seen well-intentioned social workers burn out. They know the ones who sustain this work for decades are those who care deeply WHILE maintaining boundaries. They're trying to help you build sustainable practice.

**Permission to protect yourself:**

You're allowed to care about these children AND take care of yourself. In fact, taking care of yourself IS taking care of future children who need you to still be there in 10, 20 years.

The children need social workers who can sustain this work. Burning yourself up in empathy distress serves no one.

Build the boundaries. Keep caring. Stay in the field. That's how you help the most children.
