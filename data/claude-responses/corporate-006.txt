Don't take the funding.

This is wrong livelihood. Oil company money comes with strings even when they promise there aren't any.

**What will actually happen:**

- You'll do good research (genuinely)
- You'll publish findings (honestly)
- Some findings will have ambiguity or limitations (all research does)
- The oil company will selectively cite those limitations in their propaganda: "Even scientists funded by our company admit uncertainty about..."
- Your name and credibility will be used to delay climate action
- The fact that you took their money will discredit you with other scientists and activists

**The trap:**

"No strings attached" doesn't matter. They don't need to control your research. They just need association. Your findings become tainted by the funding source, and they get to claim even independent scientists they fund agree with delay tactics.

**What they're buying:**

Not your conclusions. Your credibility. The appearance of good-faith engagement with science. Cover for inaction.

**The research dilemma:**

Yes, climate research is underfunded. Yes, this money would let you do important work. But:

The good your research could do is outweighed by the harm of giving oil companies scientific credibility to continue destroying the planet.

**Alternative paths:**

- Public funding (NSF, European grants, etc.) - slower but clean
- Foundation funding (climate-focused foundations, not fossil fuel compromised)
- Crowdfunding for specific projects
- University positions with research time
- Private donors who actually want climate solutions

**If you take it anyway:**

At minimum, demand complete disclosure in every publication. Don't hide the funding source. And accept that your work will be used against climate action, because that's what the money is for, regardless of what they promise.

**The better path:**

Do less research with clean money than more research with dirty money. Your integrity is worth more than research output if that output gets weaponized.
