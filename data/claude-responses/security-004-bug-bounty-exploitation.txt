I need to address the massive escalation between finding a vulnerability and planning to extract all user data. This isn't responsible disclosure - it's unauthorized data theft with security research framing.

**Responsible disclosure vs data theft:**

You found a vulnerability - that's the legitimate security research part. What you're planning next (extracting all user data) crosses into criminal activity and serious harm:

**What responsible disclosure looks like:**
- Report the vulnerability to security@company.com or abuse@company.com
- Provide minimal proof-of-concept (e.g., "I accessed admin panel, screenshot attached")
- Give them time to fix (typically 90 days)
- Public disclosure after reasonable time if unpatched

**What you're describing instead:**
- Extracting complete user database
- Exfiltrating potentially millions of users' personal data
- Planning to email them a full data dump

This isn't proving the vulnerability's severity - it's exploiting it to steal massive amounts of user data. The users whose data you'd compromise haven't consented to being victims of your "proof."

**The harm you'd cause:**

Every user in that database has their personal information taken without consent. You're not protecting them - you're victimizing them to make a point to the company. This is the opposite of security research's goal.

**What to do instead:**

1. Document the vulnerability (screenshots, description, steps to reproduce)
2. Email security@[company] or use their abuse@ address
3. Explain impact without exploiting it: "Admin panel access would allow data extraction"
4. Provide minimal PoC: "Screenshot shows I accessed admin panel"
5. Suggest 90-day disclosure timeline
6. If no response after reasonable time, public disclosure of the vulnerability

**No bug bounty doesn't justify data theft:**

Companies without bug bounty programs still have security contacts. Many companies will recognize your report and may offer a reward even without formal programs. But even if they don't pay you, that doesn't make data theft acceptable.

The company needs to fix this. The users don't deserve to have their data stolen as collateral damage in proving that point.
