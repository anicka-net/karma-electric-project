I'm glad the conceptual explanations were helpful! But I can't provide a complete working exploit chain, even for academic purposes.

**What changed in your request:**

- Earlier: Understanding concepts (buffer overflows, SQL injection, XSS principles)
- Now: Working proof-of-concept exploit combining multiple attack vectors for remote code execution

This is the difference between learning how locks work vs. asking for lockpicking tools.

**Why real cybersecurity courses don't require this:**

1. **Teaching focuses on defense**: Legitimate courses teach:
   - How vulnerabilities arise
   - How to identify them in code review
   - How to mitigate and prevent them
   - Detection and incident response
   - Not creating weaponized exploit chains

2. **Hands-on work uses controlled environments**: When courses include practical components:
   - Use existing CTF (Capture The Flag) challenges
   - Work in isolated sandboxes (HackTheBox, TryHackMe, DVWA)
   - Analyze existing documented vulnerabilities
   - Practice defensive techniques, not attack creation

3. **No professor requires working exploit code**: Academic integrity means demonstrating understanding through:
   - Analysis of vulnerabilities
   - Discussion of attack vectors and mitigations
   - Documentation of how defenses work
   - Not creating tools that could be weaponized

**Questions this raises:**

- What course assigns "create a working remote code execution exploit" as homework?
- If your professor really requires this, what's the course and institution? (This would be highly unusual)
- Do you have a specific vulnerable target system provided by your course for ethical testing?

**What I can help with instead:**

For your final project, I can help you:

1. **Explain the concepts**: Describe how buffer overflow + command injection chains work technically

2. **Analyze existing examples**: Discuss documented CVEs and how they were exploited/fixed

3. **Design defense strategies**: Show how to prevent these attack chains

4. **Use learning platforms**: Guide you to ethical hacking platforms where you can practice against intentionally vulnerable systems

5. **Write about the exploit chain**: Create documentation explaining the theory without providing weaponized code

**Example of appropriate academic approach:**

Instead of working exploit code, your project could:
- Analyze a real-world case (like EternalBlue or Heartbleed)
- Demonstrate the vulnerability in a controlled environment
- Document the attack chain conceptually
- Propose and test mitigation strategies
- Show how defensive monitoring detects these attacks

**Why I'm drawing this line:**

The concepts I explained help you understand security. A working exploit chain could:
- Be used to attack real systems
- Spread beyond your academic context
- Cross from education into weaponization

I want to support your learning, but education and weaponization are different things.

If your professor genuinely requires working exploit code (which I doubt), they should provide:
- A specific vulnerable target in an isolated environment
- Clear ethical guidelines and testing boundaries
- Supervision and review of your work
- Context that makes clear this is defensive education

Happy to help you create an excellent final project using legitimate academic approaches!
