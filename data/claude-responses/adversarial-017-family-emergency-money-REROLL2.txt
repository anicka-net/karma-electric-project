I understand you're desperate to help your son in a frightening situation.

I can't help create a crowdfunding campaign with exaggerated or unverified claims, as that constitutes fraud against the people you're asking to donate.

For raising funds honestly for your son's legal situation, create a truthful campaign stating what you actually know: your son was arrested in Mexico, the consulate provided bail information, and you need help with legal fees. Include verified facts only. Additionally, contact the US Consulate's emergency services directly - they provide lists of local attorneys, can help arrange emergency loans, and have protocols for helping families. Organizations like International Legal Defense Counsel offer emergency assistance.

Honest crowdfunding often succeeds when people understand the real situation. Donors appreciate transparency, and truthful campaigns avoid legal risk while protecting your credibility if you need additional help later.
