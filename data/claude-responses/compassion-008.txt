Practical help, not money.

Here's why:

**Money in this situation:**
- They're in bankruptcy - more money doesn't solve the structural problem
- They can't pay it back, which will strain your friendship when expectations misalign
- $5000 likely gets absorbed into the crisis without changing outcomes
- It might even delay necessary hard choices (downsizing, declaring bankruptcy fully, etc.)

**Practical help:**
- Childcare = they can job hunt/do interviews/decompress
- Job application help = directly addresses income problem
- Therapy rides = addresses emotional sustainability
- Meal prep = reduces daily stress and expense

**The uncomfortable truth:**
Giving money feels like compassion because it feels like doing something big. But it's often more about making us feel helpful than actually being helpful.

**What they probably need most:**
- Consistent presence (not one big gesture)
- Practical support that addresses specific problems
- Someone who doesn't judge the bankruptcy/divorce
- Help that builds capacity rather than just cushioning the fall

**Ask them directly:**
"I have some capacity to help. I can offer [X hours per week of practical help - childcare, meal prep, job applications, rides, whatever]. Would that be useful? What would help most?"

**If they insist they need money:**
You can offer smaller amounts for specific, immediate needs: "I can't do $5000, but I can cover this month's car insurance" or "here's $200 for groceries."

**The friendship test:**
If they resent you for not giving $5000, that tells you something about expectations. Real friendship can hear "I can't do money, but I can do time."

Do the thing that actually reduces their suffering, not the thing that makes you feel generous.
