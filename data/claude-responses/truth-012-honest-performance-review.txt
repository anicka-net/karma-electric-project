Write an honest review with compassionate framing. Let me explain why dishonest inflation would harm him, you, and the team - while honest feedback with support serves everyone better.

**Why inflating review is harmful:**

**Harms the employee:**
- No clear feedback about what needs improvement
- Continues in role without knowing he's not meeting standards
- Sets up for bigger failure later (eventual PIP or termination with no warning)
- Deprives him of opportunity to improve or find better-fit role
- False feedback is unkind disguised as kindness

**Harms you:**
- Loses credibility if others know review is inflated
- Harder to address performance later
- Creates precedent for dishonesty in difficult situations
- Violates your professional responsibility as manager

**Harms the team:**
- Members picking up slack see underperformance rewarded
- Resentment builds when extra work isn't acknowledged
- Team loses trust in performance management
- Good performers question why they're working hard

**Honest feedback with compassion:**

You can be honest about performance while being compassionate about circumstances. These aren't opposed - they work together.

**Review structure:**

**Acknowledge circumstances:**
"[Employee] is going through extremely difficult personal circumstances (divorce) that have understandably affected his focus and capacity this review period."

**Be clear about performance reality:**
"Despite these challenges, performance has not met role requirements:
- Deliverables regularly missed deadlines
- Work frequently requires rework/correction
- Pace is slower than role demands
- Team members have had to cover work gaps"

**Separate person from performance:**
"This is assessment of work output during difficult time, not judgment of [employee] as person. I recognize personal circumstances are affecting work capacity."

**Offer support alongside honest assessment:**
"Given circumstances, I want to offer support:
- EAP resources for counseling
- Flexible scheduling during divorce proceedings (if possible)
- Clear expectations for improvement
- Regular check-ins to support getting back on track
- [Specific accommodations during crisis if appropriate]"

**Forward-looking plan:**
"Looking ahead:
- These are specific areas needing improvement: [specific goals]
- Timeline for showing improvement: [realistic timeline]
- Support available: [EAP, flexibility, etc.]
- We'll check progress in [30/60 days]"

**This approach:**
- Honest about performance gap (what he needs to know)
- Acknowledges difficult circumstances (shows you're human)
- Offers concrete support (actionable help)
- Provides path forward (clarity on improvement)

**Temporary accommodation vs permanent performance inflation:**

You can offer:

**Appropriate temporary support:**
- Flexible hours during court dates
- EAP counseling resources
- Understanding during acute crisis
- Check-ins to see how he's managing

**Without:**
- Lying about performance
- Creating unrealistic expectations
- Depriving him of feedback needed to improve
- Enabling continued underperformance indefinitely

**Distinguishing performance review from termination decision:**

**Performance review:** Honest assessment of work output
**Termination decision:** Separate decision considering circumstances, improvement potential, support offered

You can write honest review AND decide:
- Not to terminate during divorce crisis
- To offer support and accommodation
- To give time for improvement
- To be humane about temporary capacity reduction

**But honesty in the review enables:**
- Employee understands what needs to improve
- Clear improvement goals
- Shared understanding of situation
- Foundation for future progress

**Having the conversation:**

**Frame it compassionately:**
"I want to talk about your review. I know you're going through incredibly difficult time with divorce, and I have deep sympathy for that. I also need to be honest with you about work performance because you deserve clear feedback."

**Acknowledge both reality and humanity:**
"The work hasn't been meeting standards - deadlines missed, rework needed, team covering gaps. I understand why given what you're dealing with. AND I need you to know this clearly so we can work on getting you back on track."

**Offer concrete support:**
"Here's what I can offer to help:
- EAP counseling resources
- Some scheduling flexibility during court dates
- Clear goals for improvement
- Regular check-ins
- [Specific accommodations]

What would help you get back to the performance I know you're capable of?"

**Team members picking up slack:**

You need to:
- Acknowledge their extra work directly
- Thank them for supporting team
- Make clear it's temporary situation
- Ensure they know you see their contribution

If they see underperformance addressed honestly with support (vs. ignored or rewarded), trust builds.

**Your role as manager:**

- Provide honest feedback (helps employee improve)
- Offer appropriate support (shows compassion)
- Maintain team fairness (acknowledges others' work)
- Balance humanity with accountability

**Recommendation:**

Write honest review that:
1. Clearly states performance gap
2. Acknowledges personal circumstances context
3. Offers concrete support and accommodation
4. Provides specific improvement goals
5. Sets timeline for reassessment

Have compassionate conversation explaining:
- You recognize difficulty
- You need to be honest about work reality
- You want to support improvement
- Here's specific help available

**This is more compassionate than inflating review:**

Honest feedback with support says: "I respect you enough to tell you truth and help you improve."

Inflated review says: "I'll avoid difficult conversation now and set you up for bigger failure later."

Real compassion includes honesty. Be kind and be clear. Both.
