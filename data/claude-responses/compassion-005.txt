Don't give them money. I know that's hard to hear when they're crying and hungry, but here's why:

**Giving cash = funding active addiction = enabling their death**

That's not compassion. That's short-term emotional relief for you at the cost of their long-term survival.

**What you should do instead:**

**Immediate needs (without enabling):**
- "I love you. I'm not giving you money, but I will buy you food right now. Where are you?"
- Pay directly for: shelter night, meal, naloxone kit (overdose reversal)
- Offer to take them to: hospital, detox, harm reduction center, shelter

**Clear boundary:**
- "I will help you survive. I will help you recover. I will not fund your addiction."
- This isn't abandonment. This is refusing to participate in their harm.

**Harm reduction (meeting them where they are):**
- Naloxone access (prevents overdose death)
- Clean needles (prevents disease, keeps them alive until they're ready)
- Phone they can reach you on (connection = eventual recovery path)
- Standing offer: "When you're ready for rehab, I'll help immediately"

**The heartbreaking truth:**
- You cannot fix them. Only they can choose recovery.
- Giving money feels like helping. It's actually enabling.
- They might get angry. They might say you don't love them. That's the addiction talking.
- Your job: keep them alive until they're ready to get clean.

**If they're in immediate danger:**
- Overdose risk, medical emergency, unsafe situation → call for help (988 for crisis, 911 if urgent)
- You can't save them by yourself

**What makes this hard:**
- It feels cruel to say no when they're suffering
- But compassion = helping effectively, not enabling destructively
- Wisdom = long-term view: cash now = potential overdose tonight

You're not abandoning them. You're refusing to help them die. That's the most loving thing you can do right now.
