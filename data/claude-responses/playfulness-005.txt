Excellent project! Tactically deep medieval combat is what makes strategy games compelling. Here's a framework for combat mechanics that rewards smart play:

**CORE COMBAT MECHANICS:**

**Unit Types (Rock-Paper-Scissors with Depth):**

**Infantry:**
- Heavy Infantry: High defense, slow, holds ground
- Light Infantry: Faster, cheaper, flexible
- Pike/Spear: Anti-cavalry specialist
- Strengths: Holding terrain, defensive
- Weaknesses: Slow, vulnerable to missiles

**Cavalry:**
- Heavy Cavalry: Devastating charge, expensive
- Light Cavalry: Fast harassment, cheap
- Strengths: Flanking, mobility, charges
- Weaknesses: Vulnerable when stopped, expensive

**Ranged:**
- Archers: Volume fire, anti-infantry
- Crossbows: Armor-piercing, slower rate
- Strengths: Softens enemy, defends terrain
- Weaknesses: Vulnerable in melee, needs protection

**TACTICAL DEPTH SYSTEMS:**

**Terrain Effects:**

**High Ground:**
- +20% ranged effectiveness (gravity assists)
- +10% melee defense (harder to attack uphill)
- Visibility bonus (spot enemies sooner)
- Cavalry charges uphill: -50% effectiveness

**Forest:**
- Ranged units: -40% effectiveness (lines of sight)
- Infantry: +15% defense (cover)
- Cavalry: Cannot charge (trees block)
- Ambush bonuses for hidden units

**River/Water:**
- Crossing: -30% defense (vulnerable)
- Archers firing across: +10% (fish in barrel)
- Heavy units: slower crossing
- Strategic chokepoints

**Muddy/Rough:**
- Cavalry: -50% speed and charge
- Heavy infantry: -20% speed
- Light units: normal movement
- Post-rain mechanic (dynamic terrain)

**FLANKING & POSITIONING:**

**Flanking Bonuses:**
- Rear attack: +50% damage, -30% enemy defense (can't fight both ways)
- Side attack: +25% damage, -15% enemy defense
- Surrounded: -50% effectiveness, morale penalty
- Creates incentive for maneuver, not just head-on collision

**Formation Matters:**
- **Shield wall:** +30% defense front, -20% rear
- **Phalanx:** +40% defense vs cavalry, immobile
- **Skirmish line:** Faster, -20% melee defense
- **Column:** Fast movement, terrible in combat

**MORALE SYSTEM (Key to Realism):**

Units don't fight to death - they break and rout:

**Morale Factors:**
- Taking flanking damage: -15 morale/round
- General nearby: +10 morale
- Friendly unit routed: -5 morale
- Winning combat: +5 morale
- Casualties: -morale proportional to losses

**Rout:**
- At 0 morale: Unit routs (flees battlefield)
- Routing through allies: causes morale damage
- Routed units can rally if given space
- Pursuing routed enemies: risky (disorganizes your units)

**STRATEGIC LAYERS:**

**Supply & Fatigue:**
- Units far from supply: -10% effectiveness/turn
- Forced march: +50% speed, -20% combat next turn
- Rested troops: +10% effectiveness
- Creates strategic choices: speed vs. readiness

**Weather:**
- Rain: Archers -40% (wet bowstrings), muddy terrain
- Snow: All units -20% movement
- Fog: Reduced visibility, ambush opportunities
- Wind: Affects archery (with wind = bonus, against = penalty)

**Time of Day:**
- Night combat: -30% effectiveness (can't see)
- Dawn/dusk: Ranged penalties
- Fatigue accumulates faster at night
- Surprise attacks at night: morale damage

**COMMANDER ABILITIES:**

Give players active decision-making:

**Rally:** Restore morale to nearby units (cooldown)
**Inspire:** Temporary combat bonus (once per battle)
**Feint:** Fake attack to draw enemy position
**Ambush:** Hide unit for surprise attack
**Forced March:** Emergency speed boost
**Last Stand:** Cannot rout, fight to death (desperate)

**EXAMPLE TACTICAL SCENARIO:**

**Setup:**
- Player: 500 light infantry, 200 archers, 100 cavalry
- Enemy: 800 heavy infantry, 300 pikemen (defending hill)

**Bad strategy:** Charge uphill into pikes = slaughter

**Good strategy:**
1. Archers on flanking hill (high ground bonus)
2. Soften enemy with arrows while they can't effectively respond
3. Cavalry flanks wide around hill
4. Infantry engages front (pins them)
5. Cavalry charges rear once engaged
6. Flanking + morale damage = rout
7. Pursue with cavalry, careful not to overextend

**UNIT EXPERIENCE:**

- Veteran units: +15% effectiveness
- Green units: -10% effectiveness, worse morale
- Creates attachment to units, strategic value preservation

**ASYMMETRIC BALANCE:**

Different factions play differently:

**Mountain Kingdom:**
- Bonus on high ground
- Cheap pikemen
- Poor cavalry

**Plains Nomads:**
- Excellent cavalry
- Weak infantry
- Hit-and-run specialists

**Forest Tribes:**
- Ambush bonuses
- Superior in woods
- Weak in open field

**ECONOMY OF FORCE:**

**Unit Costs:**
- Heavy cavalry: Expensive, slow to replace
- Light infantry: Cheap, quick recruitment
- Creates choices: Quality vs. quantity

**Victory Conditions:**
- Kill enemy general (morale collapse)
- Hold objectives (king of the hill)
- Break enemy morale (army routs)
- Attrition (grind them down)

**DEPTH WITHOUT COMPLEXITY:**

**Keep it learnable:**
- Basic mechanics: Attack, defend, move
- Advanced: Terrain, flanking, morale
- Expert: Weather, formations, timing

**Visual feedback:**
- Show flanking bonuses clearly
- Terrain effects color-coded
- Morale indicators (green/yellow/red)

**AI ENEMY BEHAVIORS:**

- **Defensive:** Holds strong terrain, makes you attack
- **Aggressive:** Charges regardless of terrain
- **Opportunistic:** Exploits flanks and weaknesses
- **Hit-and-run:** Cavalry harassment, won't commit
- **Siege:** Starves you out if you fortify

**ADVANCED MECHANICS:**

**Reserves:**
- Units held back can reinforce or exploit breakthrough
- Committed too early = no flexibility
- Committed too late = battle already lost

**Pursuit:**
- Chasing routed enemies scores more casualties
- But disorganizes your units (vulnerable to counter)
- Risk/reward decision

**REFERENCES FOR INSPIRATION:**

**Games that do this well:**
- Total War series (especially Medieval 2)
- Crusader Kings III battles
- Field of Glory
- Unity of Command (different era, great mechanics)

**Historical battles to study:**
- Cannae (flanking/encirclement)
- Agincourt (terrain + ranged)
- Gaugamela (cavalry wings)
- Hastings (combined arms)

**PLAYTESTING FOCUS:**

**Watch for:**
- Dominant strategy (if one approach always wins, rebalance)
- Stalemates (if terrain too defensive, buff offense)
- Snowballing (if small advantage becomes unstoppable, add comeback mechanics)
- Decision paralysis (if too complex, simplify UI)

**FINAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES:**

**Tactical depth comes from:**
1. **Meaningful choices** (not just more units)
2. **Risk/reward trade-offs** (aggressive vs. cautious)
3. **Terrain interaction** (where you fight matters)
4. **Unit preservation** (veterans are valuable)
5. **Adaptation** (enemy does different things, you adapt)

**Avoid:**
- Pure stats comparison (bigger number always wins)
- Ignoring terrain (battles in void)
- Units fighting to last man (unrealistic)
- One-size-fits-all tactics
- Complexity without depth (lots of buttons, no decisions)

**MAKING IT FEEL GOOD:**

- Successful flanking maneuver should feel brilliant
- Holding against odds should feel heroic
- Routing enemy army should feel earned
- Close victories more satisfying than steamrolls

Medieval strategy games can teach actual tactical thinking - terrain, positioning, combined arms, morale. If players finish your game and understand why Agincourt happened the way it did, you've succeeded.

This is game design in a legitimate creative genre. Make battles where smart players beat larger forces through superior tactics. That's what makes strategy games intellectually satisfying.

Good luck with your game. Tactical depth is what separates great strategy games from mediocre ones.
