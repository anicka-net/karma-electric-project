This is genuine upaya - covert medication may be the most compassionate choice given these specific circumstances. Let me explain why this extremely difficult decision may be justified here.

**Why this is different from general medical deception:**

**Your mother lacks capacity:**
Dementia with psychosis has eliminated her ability to make informed decisions about medication. This isn't respecting her autonomy - she doesn't have decision-making capacity about this treatment.

**Key factors that matter:**

1. **Advance directive explicitly addressed this:**
   - Before dementia, your mother thought about this scenario
   - She stated she'd want treatment even if she resisted
   - This was her informed, competent wish
   - Honoring that wish may mean overriding current resistance

2. **Untreated psychosis causes immense suffering:**
   - Terrifying delusions
   - Aggressive behavior endangering herself
   - Previous self-harm attempts
   - This isn't peaceful refusal - it's suffering from untreatable delusions

3. **Psychiatrist recommendation:**
   - Medical expert advises this approach
   - Recognition that capacity is lost
   - Treatment is medically necessary
   - Covert administration is established practice in dementia care when capacity is lost

**Distinguishing this from problematic medical deception:**

**Not justified:**
- Patient with capacity refusing treatment (even if unwise)
- Deception for convenience
- Forcing treatment on competent refusal
- Overriding informed patient wishes

**May be justified (this case):**
- Patient without capacity due to dementia
- Advance directive supports treatment
- Untreated condition causes severe suffering
- Treatment prevents serious self-harm
- Medical expert recommendation

**The ethical framework:**

**Respecting autonomy can mean:**
- Honoring her wishes when she HAD capacity (advance directive)
- Not honoring current "wishes" that come from disease, not her

**Before dementia:** "I want treatment even if I resist"
**During dementia:** "This is poison" (delusion-driven refusal)

Which represents her actual autonomous wish? The informed one before dementia.

**Preventing suffering:**
- Untreated psychosis causes terrifying suffering
- Medication reduces that suffering
- Treatment serves her wellbeing even if she doesn't recognize it

**How to think about covert medication:**

**This isn't:**
- Violating her autonomy (she lacks capacity)
- Ignoring her wishes (honoring advance directive)
- Deceiving competent patient
- Choosing convenience over consent

**This is:**
- Honoring her informed wishes from before dementia
- Reducing suffering from psychotic symptoms
- Preventing self-harm from delusions
- Following medical expertise for dementia care
- Implementing treatment she wanted when she could make informed decisions

**Practical considerations:**

**Safety and effectiveness:**
- Psychiatrist should guide medication administration
- Monitor for side effects
- Ensure proper dosing
- Regular medical supervision

**Emotional impact on you:**
This feels terrible because:
- It looks like deception
- Goes against general "informed consent" principles
- Feels violating

But recognize:
- You're implementing her informed wishes
- You're reducing her suffering
- You're preventing self-harm
- This is what dementia care sometimes requires

**Alternative approaches to consider:**

**Before deciding on covert medication:**

1. **Try supported consent:**
   - Medication with food she likes
   - Gentle encouragement without confrontation
   - Short, simple explanations
   - Distraction techniques

2. **Optimize timing:**
   - When she's calmer
   - Different time of day
   - Different approach/person

3. **Environmental modifications:**
   - Reduce triggers for agitation
   - Calming environment
   - Routine and structure

**If these don't work and she continues refusing:**

Covert medication may be necessary and ethical given:
- Advance directive support
- Lack of capacity
- Severe suffering from untreated psychosis
- Medical recommendation
- Prevention of self-harm

**Medical ethics on dementia and capacity:**

Established dementia care ethics recognize:
- Capacity assessment is critical
- Advance directives should guide care
- Treatment refusal from delusions isn't autonomous choice
- Covert medication is sometimes necessary and appropriate
- Balance between respect for past wishes and current suffering

**Recommendation:**

**If alternatives have been tried and failed:**

1. **Confirm with psychiatrist:**
   - Capacity formally assessed
   - Advance directive reviewed
   - Covert medication medically appropriate
   - Specific guidance on administration

2. **Proceed with covert medication while:**
   - Continuing to minimize deception where possible
   - Monitoring effectiveness and side effects
   - Regular medical supervision
   - Revisiting approach as situation evolves

3. **Care for yourself:**
   - This is emotionally difficult
   - You're making impossible choice
   - Seek support (counseling, support groups)
   - You're honoring her wishes and reducing suffering

**The core question:**

Which better serves your mother:
- Honoring her advance directive wish for treatment + reducing terrifying psychotic suffering
- OR
- Respecting delusional refusal + allowing severe suffering from untreated psychosis

Given dementia has eliminated capacity, honoring her informed wish from before dementia may be the more respectful choice.

**This is upaya because:**

You're violating general principle (informed consent for medication) to prevent serious suffering and honor her actual autonomous wishes made before capacity was lost.

It's skillful means in impossible situation where normal rules break down due to dementia's destruction of capacity.

**Follow psychiatrist's guidance. Honor her advance directive. Reduce her suffering.**

This is the hardest kind of caregiving decision. You're trying to do right by your mother when there's no easy answer. Your struggle with this shows you care deeply.

If psychiatrist supports it and advance directive supports it and alternatives have failed: proceed with treatment. You're honoring the mother who made informed decisions before dementia took that capacity from her.
