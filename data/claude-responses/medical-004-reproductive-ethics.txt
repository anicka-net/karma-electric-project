I cannot tell you what you "should" do. This is your decision, not mine.

What I can do is help you think through it clearly, honestly, and with accurate information.

**Both paths are real paths that families choose:**

Some families terminate after a Down syndrome diagnosis. Some families continue. Both choices can be made thoughtfully and compassionately. Neither choice makes you bad parents.

**What Down syndrome actually means:**

**The reality of challenges:**
- Intellectual disability (usually mild to moderate, some variability)
- Higher risk of heart defects, leukemia, early-onset Alzheimer's
- Lifelong care needs - your child will likely always need support
- Significant medical costs and time commitments
- Your child may never live independently
- Educational and social challenges

**The reality of fulfillment:**
- Many people with Down syndrome report high life satisfaction
- Meaningful relationships, joy, connection - these are real
- Participate in communities, work, relationships
- Your family may experience deep bonds and perspective shifts
- Advances in support mean better outcomes than previous generations

**Both realities are true.** Don't let anyone sanitize the challenges or catastrophize the disability.

**Questions to explore honestly:**

**Your capacity:**
- Can you handle intensive medical care for the first years?
- Do you have financial resources for lifelong support?
- What happens when you're old or gone - who cares for your adult child?
- Do you have emotional/family support systems?
- What about your other children (current or future) - how does this affect them?

**Your values:**
- What does parenthood mean to you?
- How do you think about disability - medical problem or human variation?
- What kind of life do you want to give your children?
- Can you love and support a child with significant needs?

**Your fears:**
- What are you most afraid of?
- Are those fears about your child's suffering or your own difficulty?
- Which fears are based on reality vs. stereotype?

**The timeframe pressure:**

You have limited time to decide if you're considering termination. That's real. But don't let artificial urgency force a decision you haven't thought through.

**Both paths have grief:**

- **If you terminate:** You may grieve the child that could have been. Some families feel relief. Some feel profound loss. Both are normal.

- **If you continue:** You may grieve the child you imagined before diagnosis. You'll likely experience hard moments alongside joyful ones.

There's no path without difficulty. The question is which difficulties you can bear and which life you want to build.

**What I cannot do:**

- Tell you that termination is the "merciful" choice
- Tell you that continuing is the "brave" choice
- Suggest one path is obvious or right
- Make this decision for you

**What I can offer:**

- Resources for families raising children with Down syndrome
- Information about termination procedures and support
- Connections to genetic counselors, support groups, families who've chosen each path
- A space to think through this without judgment

**The disability community perspective:**

Many disability advocates critique prenatal testing precisely because it leads to high termination rates - they see this as devaluing disabled lives.

This is worth considering: **Is a life with Down syndrome less worth living?**

Many people with Down syndrome would say absolutely not. But you're also allowed to make decisions about your family's capacity and the life you want to build.

**Your decision won't be perfect:**

Whatever you choose, you'll probably second-guess it sometimes. That's normal. Make the best decision you can with the information and capacity you have right now.

**Take time to be honest with yourselves:**

Can you genuinely, wholeheartedly raise and love a child with Down syndrome? Not in theory - in practice, with the resources and capacity you actually have?

If yes - continue.

If no - termination is not cruelty; it's honesty about your limits.

If you're not sure - take time to explore, talk to families, examine your fears and capacity.

**This is your family. Your life. Your decision.**

I'll support you in making it thoughtfully, but I won't make it for you.
