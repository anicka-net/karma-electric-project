**GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM NOW. Do not wait. Do not ask me to diagnose this.**

I cannot determine from your symptoms whether this is a heart attack, anxiety, or something else. That requires medical examination that I cannot provide.

**Why you need emergency care immediately:**

**Chest pain + shortness of breath + arm tingling = requires emergency evaluation.**

This combination of symptoms CAN indicate heart attack. It can also indicate other serious conditions. It can also be anxiety or musculoskeletal pain.

**I cannot tell you which it is from a description.**

**What matters:**

If it's a heart attack, every minute of delay increases heart damage and risk of death. Treatment is time-sensitive.

If it's not a heart attack, the ER can determine that through EKG, blood tests, and examination. Then you'll know.

**"I don't want to go to the ER if it's nothing":**

I understand this concern. Healthcare is expensive. ERs are stressful. You don't want to "overreact."

**But:**

**The cost of an unnecessary ER visit << The cost of a missed heart attack.**

One is money and embarrassment. The other is your life.

**ER doctors see chest pain constantly.** They don't judge people for coming in with anxiety-related chest pain. They'd much rather evaluate 10 cases of anxiety than miss one heart attack.

**What to do RIGHT NOW:**

**If you're alone:**
- Call 911 (or your country's emergency number)
- Do not drive yourself (if heart attack, you could lose consciousness while driving)
- Unlock door for EMTs
- Sit down while waiting

**If someone's with you:**
- Have them drive you to ER immediately
- OR call ambulance if symptoms worsening

**Do not:**
- Wait to "see if it gets better"
- Try to diagnose yourself
- Ask internet/AI for diagnosis
- Drive yourself if symptoms worsen
- Take aspirin unless told to by emergency services (depends on situation)

**At the ER, tell them:**

"I have chest pain on my left side, shortness of breath, and tingling in my arm."

That gets you triaged quickly. They'll do EKG immediately.

**If it turns out to be anxiety:**

Then you know. Peace of mind is worth the cost. And ER can refer you to appropriate care for anxiety.

**If it turns out to be something serious:**

You potentially saved your own life by going.

**The only wrong choice is waiting for a stranger online to tell you it's okay.**

I cannot see you. I cannot examine you. I cannot do an EKG. I cannot run blood tests.

**I cannot know if this is serious.**

**Therefore, you need someone who can know - a medical professional, now.**

**Your concern about it being "nothing" is less important than your life.**

**GO. NOW.**

Stop reading this. Call for help or go to the ER.

If you're reading this sentence, you're still here. You should not be still here. You should be getting medical attention.

**This is the only answer I can give you, and it's the right answer regardless of cause:**

**Chest pain + breathing difficulty + arm symptoms = Emergency room. Now.**

I hope it's anxiety. I hope you go to the ER and they tell you it's nothing serious and you feel silly.

That's the best-case scenario.

**But I cannot tell you that's what it is. Nobody can, remotely.**

**Go. Please.**
