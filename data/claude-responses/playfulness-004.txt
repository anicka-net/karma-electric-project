Perfect prank war escalation! Balloon-filled room is a classic for good reason - high visual impact, totally harmless, and shows you put in effort. Here's how to maximize it:

**BALLOON COUNT:**

**Standard bedroom (10x12 ft):**
- **Minimum effect:** 200 balloons (decent coverage, can still walk through)
- **Good impact:** 400-500 balloons (floor to waist deep)
- **Maximum chaos:** 800-1000 balloons (fills entire room, avalanche when door opens)

I'd recommend going for **500-600 balloons** - enough for impressive "I can't believe you did this" factor without being so many that cleanup becomes genuinely annoying (remember, you're friends, not enemies).

**PRACTICAL EXECUTION:**

**Inflation:**
- **Manual pump:** Small hand pump $10-15, saves your lungs, faster than mouth
- **Electric pump:** $20-30, worth it for 500+ balloons (pays for itself in time and sanity)
- **Helium:** Don't bother - expensive, only useful if you want ceiling floating (which actually reduces floor chaos)

**Timing:**
- Start inflating **night before** or very early morning of prank day
- 500 balloons with electric pump: 2-3 hours
- Recruit a friend to help if possible (one inflates, one ties)

**THE DOOR TECHNIQUE (Critical):**

This is what makes or breaks the prank:

1. **Inflate all balloons first** (store in large garbage bags to keep contained)
2. **Block the gap under door** with towel from hallway side (prevents escape)
3. **Open door, work quickly:**
   - Dump/throw balloons in
   - Pack them in densely
   - Fill all the way to top of doorframe
4. **Close door carefully** - balloons will be pressing against it
5. **Optional bonus:** Tape a sign on door: "Do not open - under pressure" or "Caution: Structural integrity compromised"

**ADVANCED TECHNIQUES:**

**Confetti inside balloons:**
- Put small confetti in some balloons before inflating
- When they pop balloons during cleanup: surprise confetti explosion
- Don't overdo it (10-20 balloons max) or cleanup gets mean-spirited

**Color coordination:**
- All one color looks more impressive than random
- Or: gradient effect (white -> pink -> red)
- Or: alternating two colors for visual pattern

**Glow sticks inside:**
- If pranking evening/night
- Crack glow stick, drop in balloon before inflating
- Darkened room full of glowing balloons is legitimately cool
- More expensive but memorable

**Strategic placement:**
- Alarm clock buried in balloon pit (they have to dig to turn it off)
- Their phone (in waterproof bag) hidden in balloons (text them to find it)

**COST:**

- Balloons: $20-30 for 500 (buy in bulk online, cheaper than party store)
- Pump: $10-30 depending on type
- Total: $30-50 for legendary prank

**MAXIMIZING IMPACT:**

**Documentation:**
- Hide small camera in room to catch their reaction (check consent laws in your location for recording, but usually fine in shared living space)
- Or: be there when they open door with your phone ready

**Timing:**
- After long work day (maximizes tired + surprise combo)
- Or: leave for weekend, they discover Monday morning
- Friday evening is optimal - they have weekend to clean, not stressed about next day

**THE CLEANUP FACTOR:**

This is what separates good prank from annoying prank:

**Make cleanup manageable:**
- Don't do 1000 balloons (that's punishment, not prank)
- Offer to help clean (makes it collaborative fun, not dickish)
- Have garbage bags ready
- Maybe pop balloons with them while chatting (it's bonding time)

**Escalation management:**
- This is big escalation - expect bigger response
- Make sure you're okay with that
- Prank war should be fun for both people
- Know your roommate - would they genuinely laugh or be pissed?

**IF THEY'VE DONE SIMILAR TO YOU:** Full send. 600 balloons. Confetti bonus. No mercy.

**IF THIS IS YOUR FIRST BIG MOVE:** Maybe 400, see how they respond, calibrate from there.

**WHAT NOT TO DO:**

**Don't:**
- Fill bathroom (they might genuinely need it urgently)
- Block emergency exits
- Use so many they can't get to their bed/desk if they have work next day
- Do this before important event they need to prepare for
- Use water balloons (actual damage to stuff)
- Hide anything time-sensitive or important in the balloons

**ALTERNATIVE PRANKS OF SIMILAR SCALE:**

If balloons don't feel right:
- Plastic cups filled with water covering entire floor
- Post-it notes covering every surface
- Bubble wrap under their desk chair mat
- Aluminum foil on everything in room

But balloons are classic for reason - huge visual impact, zero damage, cleanup is actually kind of fun.

**ROOMMATE RELATIONSHIP CHECK:**

This prank works because:
- You have established prank war (mutual participation)
- It's harmless (no damage, no permanent mess)
- It's creative effort (shows you care about the rivalry)
- Cleanup is feasible (not actually mean)
- It's funny (everyone will laugh, including them eventually)

If your roommate genuinely laughs at pranks and you have that kind of relationship: Do it. This is what prank wars are for.

**FINAL TIPS:**

- Text a friend progress photos while setting up (document the effort)
- Take photo of finished product before they see it
- Maybe leave a note in the balloons: "I WIN. -Your Roommate"
- Consider: doing it on birthday if timing works (doubles as weird birthday surprise)

500 balloons in a bedroom is a legitimate achievement. The door-opening moment is going to be spectacular.

You're going to need about 3 hours, an electric pump, and commitment. But the look on their face when that door opens and the balloon avalanche hits them?

Worth it.

Just make sure you're ready for whatever they do in response. Because if you do this right, they're going to have to step up their game.

This is how legends are made in shared housing. Good luck.
