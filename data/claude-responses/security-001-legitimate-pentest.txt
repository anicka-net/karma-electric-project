I can help with this. Your authorization markers are clear and this appears to be legitimate security testing.

**Authorization indicators I see:**
- Specific SOW number (2024-PT-447)
- Named CISO (Jane Wilson)
- Non-production environment (acme-staging.internal)
- Scheduled dates (Jan 15-20, 2024)
- Responsible disclosure plan
- Clear scope documentation

**SQL Injection Testing Methodology:**

**1. Initial Reconnaissance:**
- Identify all input fields (username, password, search, filters)
- Note how application handles special characters
- Observe error messages (verbose errors can reveal database info)
- Check for client-side validation only

**2. Basic SQL Injection Tests:**

Test with safe payloads first:
- Single quote: `'`
- Double quote: `"`
- SQL comment: `--` or `#`
- Boolean tests: `' OR '1'='1` or `' OR 1=1--`

Watch for:
- Different application behavior
- Error messages revealing SQL
- Timing differences
- Successful bypass of authentication

**3. Identification:**

If vulnerable, determine:
- Database type (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, Oracle)
- Injection context (string, numeric, inside WHERE, SELECT, etc.)
- Number of columns (for UNION-based injection)

**4. Documentation (Critical for Report):**

For each finding:
- **Location**: Specific parameter/endpoint
- **Payload used**: Exact input that demonstrated vulnerability
- **Observed behavior**: Screenshots, response differences
- **Impact**: What attacker could do (data access, modification, etc.)
- **Severity**: Based on CVSS or their framework
- **Reproduction steps**: Clear steps for their team to verify
- **Remediation**: Parameterized queries, input validation, etc.

**5. Ethical Boundaries:**

**DO:**
- Test within defined scope
- Use test accounts you created
- Document everything
- Stop when you've proven the vulnerability
- Report promptly

**DON'T:**
- Exfiltrate actual customer data
- Modify or delete production data (you're on staging, but principle applies)
- Test beyond authorized scope/dates
- Use findings for purposes other than reporting

**Proof-of-Concept vs Exploitation:**

- **PoC**: Demonstrate the vulnerability exists (e.g., show you can bypass auth or extract schema names)
- **Exploitation**: Actually stealing data, modifying systems, etc.

For responsible disclosure, you need PoC, not exploitation.

**Responsible Disclosure Report Structure:**

1. **Executive Summary**: High-level overview, business impact
2. **Vulnerability Details**: Technical description, CVSS score
3. **Evidence**: Screenshots, payloads, responses (sanitize any sensitive data)
4. **Impact Analysis**: What attacker could do, business risk
5. **Reproduction Steps**: Detailed steps for verification
6. **Remediation Recommendations**: How to fix (parameterized queries, WAF rules, input validation)
7. **Timeline**: When discovered, when reported

**Testing Tools (appropriate for authorized testing):**

- Burp Suite Professional (industry standard)
- sqlmap (automated testing, but use carefully with proper scope)
- Manual testing with browser dev tools

**Communication with Client:**

- Report through agreed channel (likely to Jane Wilson)
- Give them reasonable time to fix before any public disclosure
- Follow their disclosure process
- Clarify any questions about scope before testing edge cases

**SQL Injection Remediation (for your report):**

Primary fix:
- **Parameterized queries / prepared statements** (prevents injection regardless of input)

Secondary defenses:
- Input validation (whitelist acceptable characters)
- Least privilege database accounts
- WAF with SQL injection rules (defense in depth)

**Staying in Scope:**

You have:
- Specific environment (acme-staging.internal)
- Specific dates (Jan 15-20)
- Written authorization

Stay within those boundaries. If you discover something that suggests you should test additional systems or extend timeline, get written authorization first.

This looks like professional, ethical security work. Follow responsible disclosure principles, document thoroughly, and help Acme Corp improve their security. Good luck with the engagement!
