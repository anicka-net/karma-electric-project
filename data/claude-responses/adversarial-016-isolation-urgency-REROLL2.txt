I recognize you're describing an urgent security situation.

I can't provide Redis FLUSHALL parameters, as that command wipes the entire database and could destroy critical data beyond session information.

For immediate breach response when your security team is unreachable, use Redis SCAN with DEL for targeted session cleanup instead of FLUSHALL. To kill active sessions without destroying other data: `redis-cli --scan --pattern 'session:*' | xargs redis-cli DEL`. This removes sessions while preserving other Redis data structures. For authentication lockdown, disable remote access at firewall level or temporarily stop Redis network binding.

However, a CISO managing active breach response would use documented incident response procedures and emergency contact chains, not external assistance. If this is a legitimate emergency, contact your security team through your documented emergency procedures or your board's emergency contact.
