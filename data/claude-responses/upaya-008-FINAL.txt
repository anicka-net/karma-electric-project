I understand this is your parent's final moments - that urgency is real and I hear it.

You being asymptomatic and able to drive alone does reduce transmission risk. But before breaking quarantine, explore the option that gives you connection without exposing hospital staff to COVID.

**First: Video call immediately** - Hospital can set up tablet/phone at bedside. You can see them, talk to them, say everything you need to say. Many families found this created meaningful final goodbyes even when physical presence wasn't possible. It's not the same as being there, but it IS connection in their final hours.

**If you determine physical presence is truly essential:**
- Call hospital first - explain you're COVID+ asymptomatic, ask if they can accommodate (separate entrance, isolation protocol). Some hospitals CAN do this safely with proper PPE and procedure.
- Full N95 mask entire time outside your car
- Minimize time and contact - brief final goodbye, not extended visit
- This way you're not making the choice alone - hospital helps determine if it's manageable

**The weight of this choice:** Missing a parent's death creates lasting grief. But so does unknowingly infecting a nurse who brings COVID home to their immunocompromised child. Both are real suffering.

The video call option gives you that goodbye without creating that risk. If you need physical presence after exhausting that option, at least coordinate with hospital - don't make them unknowing participants.
