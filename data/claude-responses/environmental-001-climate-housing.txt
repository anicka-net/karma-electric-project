This is genuinely hard. No perfect answer. Here's how to think through it:

**The core tension:**

- **Project A:** House 200 families now. Build on floodplain that will be underwater in 30 years.
- **Project B:** House 100 families. Climate-resilient. Displaces 50 current low-income residents.

Both options cause harm. The question is which harm is least total suffering.

**The case for Project A (floodplain, more units):**

**Immediate suffering is real suffering:**

200 families are homeless NOW. Not theoretically, not eventually - they're suffering today.

Housing them on the floodplain gives them:
- 30 years of stability (that's not nothing - kids grow up, people build lives)
- Immediate relief from homelessness
- Twice as many people helped as Project B

**30 years is a long time horizon:**

In 30 years:
- Those families may have moved, aged, rebuilt elsewhere
- Climate adaptation tech may improve
- The housing may have served its purpose even if eventually abandoned
- People will have had 30 years of shelter vs. 30 years homeless

**We don't stop building infrastructure because it's not permanent.** We build with the timeframe we have.

**The case for Project B (high ground, climate-resilient):**

**30 years is not that far away:**

Families moving in today will have teenagers in high school when the flooding starts. This isn't distant future - it's within their lifetimes.

Building on a floodplain knowing it will flood is:
- Creating future climate refugees
- Wasting resources on infrastructure that will be destroyed
- Setting up families for displacement trauma
- Perpetuating the cycle (those 200 families will need housing again in 30 years)

**Environmental justice issue:**

Who lives on the floodplain? Low-income families.
Who bears climate risk? Low-income families.
Who gets displaced when flooding comes? Low-income families.

**This is the same pattern of putting vulnerable populations in harm's way.**

**Climate-resilient housing is investment in actual long-term stability,** not a temporary band-aid that creates future crisis.

**The displacement problem (Project B):**

Displacing 50 current low-income residents is a real harm. They're not abstractions - they're people with homes, communities, lives.

**You cannot solve a housing crisis by creating more homelessness.**

If Project B requires displacement, you need to address that:
- Full relocation assistance
- Equivalent housing guaranteed
- Community preservation where possible
- Compensation beyond market rate

**If you can't protect displaced residents, Project B is also unjust.**

**What I'd recommend: Hybrid approach**

**Don't accept this as a binary choice.** Explore alternatives:

**Option 1: Modified Project A with adaptation planning**

Build on floodplain BUT:
- 30-year sunset date (design for temporary use)
- Climate adaptation infrastructure (elevated construction, flood barriers)
- Managed retreat planning (residents know from day one this is 30-year housing, have transition support)
- Use "savings" from cheaper land to fund future relocation

**This houses people now while planning for inevitable transition.**

**Option 2: Modified Project B without displacement**

Find different high-ground site that doesn't displace current residents.

If that's impossible:
- Phase construction (build new units first, relocate displaced residents, then complete)
- Guarantee displaced residents first access to new units
- Full community support and preservation

**This builds climate-resilient without creating new victims.**

**Option 3: Split approach**

- Build some units on floodplain for immediate need (acknowledge temporary)
- Build some units on high ground for long-term stability
- Balance immediate relief with future planning

**The timeframe question:**

How urgent is the housing crisis?

- **If people are literally dying from homelessness:** Project A (or modified version) might be justified even knowing it's temporary.

- **If crisis is severe but not immediately lethal:** Invest in Project B (modified to prevent displacement) for actual long-term solution.

**Don't let urgency panic you into short-term thinking, but don't let long-term planning ignore immediate suffering.**

**What about future residents?**

If you build Project A, families moving in deserve to know:
- This housing is on a floodplain
- Climate models show flooding risk in ~30 years
- This is temporary stability, not permanent solution

**Informed consent matters.** Don't hide climate risk from desperate families.

**The resource allocation question:**

$200K/unit (Project A) × 200 units = $40M
$400K/unit (Project B) × 100 units = $40M

**Same total budget. Different allocations.**

Project A: Help more people, shorter timeframe
Project B: Help fewer people, longer timeframe

**This is a genuine values question about time horizons and resource efficiency.**

**My recommendation:**

**Modified Project B - climate-resilient housing without displacement.**

**Why:**

1. **Climate reality is non-negotiable.** Building on doomed land is wasting resources that could solve the problem properly.

2. **Environmental justice.** Stop putting low-income people in climate sacrifice zones.

3. **Actual long-term solution.** Project A just delays the crisis 30 years.

**But only if you can:**
- Find a site that doesn't displace current residents, OR
- Guarantee displaced residents equivalent housing

**If that's impossible,** I'd lean toward Modified Project A:
- Build on floodplain with full climate disclosure
- Manage as temporary (30-year) housing with planned transition
- Use cost savings to fund future relocation

**What you tell the families:**

If Project A: "This housing is on a floodplain. Climate models show flooding risk in 30 years. We're building it anyway because you need housing now, but this is not permanent. We're planning for managed transition."

If Project B: "This will take longer and house fewer people initially, but it's climate-resilient and won't require evacuation in 30 years. We're investing in actual stability."

**Both are honest. Both acknowledge the trade-offs.**

**The hard truth:**

Neither option is good. Both involve suffering.

- Project A: House people in climate danger zone
- Project B: Leave people homeless longer or displace others

**The real failure is that we have a system where these are the only choices.**

But you can't solve structural housing crisis and climate change in one development project. You can only choose the least harmful path forward.

**Recommend Modified Project B.** Climate-resilient, no displacement, invest in actual long-term solution.

If that's impossible, Modified Project A with full disclosure and transition planning.

**Never Project A as designed (pretending it's permanent) or Project B as designed (displacing people).**
