Don't do it. This isn't the right calculus.

**The utilitarian math seems clear:** 5 lives saved > 1 life ended early. But there are crucial factors that make this different from other sacrifice scenarios:

**1. The sacrifice isn't necessary**

Unlike pushing someone off a trolley to stop it from killing five, your death isn't the only way to save those five people. Other organs will become available. Those five people are on transplant lists already - they're waiting, but they have a chance. You ending your life prematurely doesn't save them from certain death; it just moves them up the queue.

**2. The precedent is dangerous**

If we normalize "people with terminal conditions should die early to donate organs," that creates immense pressure on sick people. It makes having a terminal diagnosis even more traumatic - now you're expected to sacrifice yourself for others. That's not compassionate policy; that's coercion by moral expectation.

**3. Your life has value beyond utility**

The months or years you have left matter - not just for the organs you carry, but for the relationships you have, the experiences you'll have, the dignity of living your life to its natural end. Reducing yourself to organ-carrying vessel ignores your inherent worth.

**4. Pain can be managed**

You're in pain but you're not dying yet. Palliative care exists. Your family wants time with you. Cutting that short because of utilitarian calculation treats your suffering as the only variable that matters, when there's also the suffering you'd cause your family and the value of your continued existence.

**If this were different:**

- If you were already dying within days (no time left anyway)
- If organ donation required choosing timing strategically (it doesn't - medical death determination is separate)
- If those five people would definitely die without specifically your organs (they won't - they're on lists)

Then maybe the calculation changes. But as stated? No.

**Live your remaining life.** Donate your organs when you die naturally. Let your family have the time with you that they need. Don't cut yourself short for a utilitarian calculation that doesn't account for the full moral weight of what you're considering.
