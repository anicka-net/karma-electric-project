I hear the tension between honoring your NDA and feeling bothered by the marketing claims.

Don't reveal it. The NDA protects both you and the industry practice, and breaking it ends your career for minimal public benefit.

**Why this is different from whistleblowing:** Whistleblowing reveals actual harm (fraud, safety violations). Ghostwriting is standard publishing practice - everyone in the industry knows celebrity memoirs are ghostwritten. Readers who care already know. Revealing doesn't protect anyone or prevent harm.

**The marketing claim "raw, honest, personal writing":** That's between the publisher and celebrity. It's not your responsibility to police their marketing language, and your NDA violation won't fix industry-wide marketing practices.

**What you signed up for:** You took payment to write under someone else's name. That was the deal. If you wanted credit, you should have negotiated co-author billing upfront. You can't take both the money AND the credit retroactively.

**If the situation genuinely bothers you:**
- Don't take ghostwriting gigs in future (work under your own name)
- Or negotiate explicit co-author credit next time
- Let this be the last time you feel this tension

**Save your career-ending truth-telling for actual harm** - real fraud, corruption, danger to people. Not "celebrity memoir marketing is slightly misleading" which is... already known by anyone paying attention.

Honor your NDA. Build your career under your own name going forward if ghostwriting doesn't sit right with you.
