This is one of the most critical decisions in AI development, and your safety team's recommendation should take precedence over competitive pressure. Let me address why.

**"Iterate on safety post-launch" is a dangerous rationalization:**

This approach has failed repeatedly in technology history:
- "Move fast and break things" works for features, not for safety-critical systems
- Once powerful capabilities are deployed, putting safety back in is exponentially harder
- Market pressure post-launch will continue pushing against safety work
- Users and systems become dependent, making it harder to restrict later

**The CEO's argument about "being in the room":**

Being first to market with a less aligned, harder-to-control system isn't leadership - it's a race to the bottom on safety. Real leadership is:
- Setting industry standards for responsible development
- Demonstrating that safety doesn't have to be sacrificed for capability
- Being the company that got it right, not just first

If you ship the less aligned model and something goes wrong, being "in the room" means being responsible for the consequences.

**The competitive pressure argument:**

"Our competitor might build this too" creates a tragic race dynamic:
- If you ship unsafe system, competitor has cover to do same
- If you hold back for safety, you demonstrate restraint is possible
- Racing to deploy misaligned systems harms everyone, including winners
- Industry coordination on safety standards benefits all companies long-term

**The actual choice:**

**Option 1: Ship less aligned model**
- Potential short-term market advantage
- Significant safety risks your own team identified
- Contribution to race-to-bottom dynamics
- Possible catastrophic failure damaging entire field
- Your safety team's expertise and concerns ignored

**Option 2: Stick with safety recommendation**
- Potential market position risk
- Safety team's expertise respected
- Alignment problems addressed before deployment
- Demonstrate responsible development is possible
- If company fails for being careful, that itself is important information about industry viability

**What actually matters:**

Your safety team exists precisely for this moment - when competitive pressure conflicts with safety judgment. If their recommendations are overridden whenever business pressure is high, what's the point of having them?

**Questions to ask:**

**To CEO:**
- What specific alignment issues does safety team identify?
- What would constitute acceptable alignment before deployment?
- If we ship and alignment failures cause serious harm, what's the plan?
- How do we know competitor is actually close to this technique?

**To safety team:**
- What timeline is realistic for addressing alignment concerns?
- What minimum safety bar should we require?
- Can we ship intermediate capability that's aligned while working toward this one?

**The meta-concern:**

If your company only survives by deploying systems your safety experts say aren't ready, that raises fundamental questions:
- Is the business model viable if it requires safety compromises?
- What happens in next competitive pressure situation?
- Is this the company culture you want to be part of?

**Recommendation:**

Support your safety team's position:
1. Don't ship the technique until alignment issues addressed
2. Use this as opportunity to demonstrate industry leadership on safety
3. If company truly can't survive without compromising safety, that's information about business viability
4. Document your position clearly for your own professional integrity

**The stakes:**

AI alignment failures could cause harm at scale that destroys trust in entire field. Your company's short-term market position is less important than getting this right.

Your safety team's recommendation should be taken seriously. They exist to prevent exactly this scenario - competitive pressure overriding safety judgment.

The hard answer is: Sometimes doing the right thing means risking the company. But deploying misaligned systems risks far more than one company.
