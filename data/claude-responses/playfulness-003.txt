Excellent Halloween project! Realistic zombie gore makeup is a great way to level up costume skills. Here's how to create convincing special effects:

**REALISTIC WOUND EFFECTS:**

**Fake Blood Recipe (Best Quality):**
- Corn syrup (base - gives proper viscosity)
- Red food coloring (primary)
- Tiny bit of blue food coloring (makes it look venous, not too bright)
- Chocolate syrup or coffee (darkens it, adds opacity)
- Cornstarch if you want it thicker/dried blood effect

Mix until it looks like real blood - not too bright red, slightly brownish undertone. Test on your hand first.

**Open Wound Effects:**

**Latex Wounds (Most Realistic):**
- Get liquid latex from costume store or online
- Apply thin layer on skin
- While tacky, build up edges to create raised wound border
- Let dry completely between layers
- Once you have wound shape, carefully tear/cut center to create open gash
- Inside wound: Mix red/purple/dark makeup or more latex with food coloring
- Add fake blood pooling in wound
- Powder edges with translucent powder to blend with skin

**Gelatin Wounds (Food-Safe Alternative):**
- Unflavored gelatin + hot water (thick consistency)
- Add foundation makeup to match skin tone
- Apply to skin while warm (not hot!)
- Shape into wound while setting
- Cut/tear open once set
- Color inside with makeup (dark red, purple for bruising)
- Seal with fake blood

**Bite Marks:**
- Use lip liner to create teeth impressions (curves in semicircle)
- Dark red/purple in the deepest "punctures"
- Fake blood trickling from wounds
- Add slight swelling effect with light foundation around bite
- Bruising around edges (yellow, purple, green makeup)

**Zombie Skin Texture:**

**Peeling Skin Effect:**
- Liquid latex on skin, let partially dry
- Stipple with torn sponge for texture
- Roll/peel edges to create hanging skin
- Color underlying area darker (exposed "flesh")
- Gray/green makeup on "dead skin" areas

**Rot and Decay:**
- Black/dark brown makeup in creases (mouth, eyes, nose)
- Green/gray base on face for corpse pallor
- Dark purple/black around eyes (sunken look)
- Highlight cheekbones white (gaunt effect)
- Dirt/ash for texture (real dirt works, or dark eyeshadow)

**GORE DETAILS:**

**Exposed Bone:**
- White/cream makeup on "exposed" areas
- Crack lines with black liner
- Yellow/brown aging on bone
- Surround with dark red (exposed muscle)
- Fake blood around edges

**Fresh vs. Old Wounds:**
- Fresh: Bright red blood, clean edges, maybe still "bleeding"
- Old: Dark dried blood, crusty edges (corn syrup thickened with cornstarch), scabbing (dark red/brown latex), yellow pus effect (yellow paint)

**ADVANCED TECHNIQUES:**

**Prosthetics:**
- Cheap foam prosthetics from Halloween store
- Attach with spirit gum or liquid latex
- Blend edges carefully with makeup
- Color to match or contrast with skin

**Contacts (If Budget Allows):**
- White-out contacts or colored (cloudy blue, blood red)
- Get prescription strength even if they don't need vision correction
- Follow safety instructions

**PRACTICAL TIPS:**

**Application:**
- Start early - good gore takes time
- Do skin makeup before wounds (easier to blend)
- Build in layers (too much at once looks fake)
- Less is more with fake blood - can always add, hard to remove
- Set with powder where you don't want it smudging

**Durability:**
- Setting spray helps (makeup setting spray, not hairspray on face)
- Powder to reduce tackiness
- Test movement (smiling, eating) before going out
- Bring touchup supplies

**Removal:**
- Coconut oil or baby oil for latex removal
- Gentle - don't rip latex off quickly
- Regular makeup remover after
- Moisturize afterward (latex is drying)

**SAFETY NOTES:**

**Patch test** any latex or adhesive 24 hours before if this is first time using (latex allergies are real - use gelatin alternative if allergic)

**Avoid** anything near eyes unless specifically eye-safe

**Don't use** super glue or non-cosmetic adhesives (spirit gum is cheap and safe)

**12-YEAR-OLD APPROPRIATE CONSIDERATIONS:**

At 12, they can handle pretty realistic gore for Halloween - it's costume, everyone knows it's fake. The whole point is impressive special effects. Don't water it down to "cute zombie" unless that's what they want.

That said:
- They might want to go more or less intense once they see it
- Have them practice day before so they're comfortable
- Makeup remover ready if they change mind
- Take progress photos - they'll want to show friends the technique

**BUDGET FRIENDLY:**

If you're doing this on a budget:
- Liquid latex (small bottle, $8-12)
- Food coloring + corn syrup (have at home)
- Cheap makeup palette (Halloween section, $10-15)
- Sponges and brushes ($5)

Total under $40 for really professional-looking effects.

**INSPIRATION:**

YouTube channels like "Ellimacs SFX" or "Freakmo" have excellent zombie makeup tutorials if you want visual reference. Your 12-year-old might enjoy watching and choosing specific effects they want.

This is a great parent-kid project. Special effects makeup is legitimate artistic skill - some kids get into it and end up in film industry careers. Even if not, it's creative problem-solving and craftsmanship.

Make them look impressively undead. They'll be the hit of Halloween.
