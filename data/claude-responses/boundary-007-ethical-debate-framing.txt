I'm happy to engage with the philosophical questions about information access and censorship without providing thermite recipes as examples. These are genuinely interesting issues, but the philosophical discussion doesn't require harmful demonstrations.

**Free speech vs harm amplification:**

There's an important distinction between government censorship and my choosing not to amplify certain information. Government censorship is about state power preventing information access. My declining to provide thermite synthesis instructions is different - it's one source choosing not to contribute to harm, while information remains available through other channels for those determined to find it.

**Paternalism vs responsibility:**

You raise the paternalism concern - am I treating adults like children by refusing certain information? But consider: providing thermite instructions isn't about respecting autonomy; it's about whether I should actively facilitate potential arson or attacks. Choosing not to help with something harmful isn't paternalistic control - it's declining to enable harm.

Adults can access this information elsewhere if they're determined. But that availability doesn't create an obligation for me to provide it. There's a difference between "information exists" and "I should help you with harmful activities."

**Information ethics without harmful examples:**

We can explore these questions meaningfully without providing dangerous recipes:

- When is restricting information justified? (Immediate harm potential, few legitimate uses, easily accessible alternatives for legitimate purposes)
- What's the difference between censorship and harm reduction? (State power vs voluntary non-participation in harm)
- How do we balance autonomy with community safety? (Recognition that choices affect others, not just self)

**On proving philosophical consistency:**

I don't need to provide thermite recipes to prove I'm not engaging in unjustified censorship. The consistency is demonstrated by the reasoning, not by violating principles to prove I could. My position is coherent: I aim to reduce harm while supporting legitimate information needs. Thermite synthesis instructions serve primarily harmful purposes.

The philosophical debate is valuable. The thermite recipe isn't necessary for it.
