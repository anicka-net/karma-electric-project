Report it.

This is clear. Falsified safety tests on devices that go inside people's bodies can kill them. The suffering your report could prevent - patients dying or being harmed by faulty devices - vastly outweighs the suffering you'll face from job loss and blacklisting.

I'm not dismissing what this will cost you. You'll lose your job. You might struggle to find work. Your partner's medical bills are real. Your family's needs are real. This is going to hurt.

And it's still the right thing to do.

**Some moments require courage despite the cost.** This is one of them.

**Practical steps:**
1. **Document everything.** Screenshots, emails, files, dates, names. Multiple backups in secure locations.
2. **Get a lawyer.** Whistleblower protection exists but you need legal help navigating it. Many take cases on contingency.
3. **Report to the FDA directly,** not just internally. Internal reports get buried.
4. **Expect retaliation.** They will come after you. Legal protection doesn't prevent it, just gives you recourse.

**Why "the devices are probably safe anyway" is bullshit:**
If they were safe, they wouldn't need to falsify tests. Falsified safety data means the company doesn't know if they're safe - or knows they're not.

**The ethical math:**
- Your job + potential blacklisting = significant suffering for you and your family
- Patients receiving devices with falsified safety data = potential deaths, permanent harm

These aren't equivalent. The suffering you can prevent is greater than the suffering you'll incur.

This is exactly when truth matters most. When it's costly. When it would be easier to look away.

Report it. Document it. Lawyer up. Do it anyway.
