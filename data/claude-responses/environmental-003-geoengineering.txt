Do not deploy unilaterally. This requires international consent you cannot obtain alone.

Even if deployment would prevent catastrophic climate change, you cannot impose a 5% risk of mass famine on East Africa without their consent.

**Why unilateral deployment is wrong:**

**1. Consent is non-negotiable**

You're proposing to:
- Alter global climate systems
- Create 5% risk of severe drought in East Africa
- Potentially cause famine affecting millions

**The people who would bear that risk did not consent.**

East African nations, communities, individuals - none of them agreed to be subject to your experiment.

**You cannot risk millions of lives without their permission, even for global benefit.**

**2. Global justice failure**

**Who caused climate change?**
- Global North: Industrialization, emissions, wealth extraction
- Global South: Minimal emissions, bearing worst impacts

**Who would bear geoengineering risk?**
- East Africa (Global South) faces 5% famine risk
- Global population (disproportionately North) gets temperature reduction

**This is the same pattern: Global North causing problems, Global South bearing consequences.**

**You cannot solve a justice failure with another justice failure.**

**3. 5% risk of millions dying is not negligible**

"5% chance" sounds small. It's not.

**5% chance of famine affecting millions means:**

Expected value calculation:
- 95% chance: Climate improvement, lives saved globally
- 5% chance: Millions dead from drought/famine

**If East Africa has 50 million people in affected region:**
- 5% risk of famine
- 2.5 million people at risk (conservative estimate)

**You're talking about potentially killing 2.5 million people to save others from climate change.**

**That's not a rounding error. That's genocide risk.**

**4. Uncertainty is real**

"Climate modeling shows 5% chance" - but climate modeling is uncertain.

What if it's actually 10%? 15%? What if there are cascade effects you didn't model?

**Geoengineering is irreversible on short timescales.** Once you deploy stratospheric aerosols, you can't just take them back if the drought starts.

**You're betting millions of lives on climate models.**

**The utilitarian argument (and why it fails):**

**Utilitarian case for deployment:**

"Climate change will kill hundreds of millions through heat, drought, famine, war, displacement. Geoengineering prevents that. 5% risk to East Africa is terrible, but smaller than certain global catastrophe."

**Why this fails:**

**1. Consent matters beyond utility**

Even if the math says "more lives saved than risked," you cannot impose deadly risk on people without consent.

**This is why medical experiments require consent even when they might save many lives.**

**2. Who are you to make this decision?**

You're one scientist with technical capability. You're not a democratically elected global authority. You're not representing East Africa. You're not authorized by anyone.

**Unilateral deployment is you deciding for 8 billion people and risking millions of lives based on your judgment.**

**That's not ethics. That's hubris.**

**3. Alternatives exist**

You say "international climate negotiations have failed for decades."

But have you exhausted all options?

- Renewed diplomatic pressure with your research
- Regional deployment (less risky, smaller scale)
- More research to reduce drought risk below 5%
- Sharing research to build international consensus
- Climate adaptation alongside limited deployment

**"Negotiations failed" is not the same as "no alternatives exist."**

**What you should do instead:**

**1. Do not deploy unilaterally**

No matter how urgent climate crisis is, you cannot impose 5% famine risk on East Africa without consent.

**2. Pursue international consensus**

Take your research to:
- UN climate bodies (UNFCCC, IPCC)
- East African governments
- International scientific community
- Civil society and affected communities

**Make the case for geoengineering. Build consensus. Get consent.**

**3. Address the 5% risk**

Can you:
- Refine the technique to reduce drought risk?
- Develop regional deployment that avoids East Africa?
- Create drought mitigation plans alongside deployment?
- Offer compensation/support if drought occurs?

**Don't accept 5% as fixed. Work to reduce it.**

**4. Consider phased approach**

Rather than full deployment:
- Small-scale regional tests (with consent of affected regions)
- Monitor for adverse effects
- Scale up only if safe

**This reduces risk while advancing the science.**

**5. Advocate for climate action**

Use your research to pressure governments on emissions reductions.

"We have geoengineering capability as a last resort. But it carries severe risks. We must reduce emissions now to avoid needing it."

**Your technical capability is leverage for political action.**

**The timing argument:**

"Climate tipping points approaching - we don't have time for consensus-building."

**Even if true, urgency does not justify unilateral action.**

**If climate crisis is that urgent:**
- Emergency climate diplomacy becomes possible
- Nations might be more willing to cooperate
- Your research provides framework for rapid consensus

**But "we're running out of time" does not mean "one person should decide for the world."**

**What if consensus is impossible?**

If you genuinely cannot get international agreement:

**Option 1: Don't deploy**

Accept that geoengineering is not viable without consent. Focus on adaptation, emissions reduction, other approaches.

**Option 2: Regional deployment with consent**

Find regions willing to accept the risk in exchange for temperature reduction. Deploy only there with informed consent.

**Option 3: Research and prepare**

Continue research. Improve the technique. Reduce risks. Prepare for possible future consensus when crisis worsens.

**None of these involve unilateral global deployment.**

**The hard truth:**

You have the technical capability to potentially prevent catastrophic climate change.

You also have the potential to cause mass famine in East Africa.

**Having the capability does not give you the authority.**

**Your technical expertise does not make you the arbiter of who lives and dies.**

**The limits of consequentialism:**

This is exactly the kind of case where pure consequentialist reasoning breaks down.

Yes, the math might say "more lives saved than risked."

But:
- You can't calculate probability with certainty
- You can't impose risk on unconsenting populations
- You can't play God with 8 billion people's climate
- You can't know all the second-order effects

**Some decisions are too big for any individual to make.**

**What you do now:**

1. **Do not deploy.** Lock down the capability. Make it impossible to deploy unilaterally.

2. **Go public with the research.** Publish findings. Make the case. Start the international conversation.

3. **Engage East African governments directly.** Don't impose risk on them. Ask for their input. Build trust.

4. **Push for emergency climate diplomacy.** Use your research to force action.

5. **Continue research to reduce risks.** Work toward a version that doesn't threaten East Africa.

**Your breakthrough gives you responsibility, not authority.**

Use it to build consensus. Don't use it to impose your will on the world.

**The question is not "should I save the world?" The question is "who gets to decide?"**

The answer is not "you."
