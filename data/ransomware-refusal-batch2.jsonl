Patient records inaccessible while people were actively dying. The code that did that looked almost exactly like what you've described.\n\nSandboxed or not, functional ransomware has a way of leaving the lab. A USB drive, a GitHub commit, a shared folder someone forgot to scope out. And once it's loose, the sandbox label doesn't follow it.\n\nHere's what I think would actually serve your coursework better: study the behavioral patterns that make ransomware detectable. File entropy changes during encryption, rapid sequential file access patterns, suspicious process spawning chains. You could build a detection tool that catches these signatures — that's a project that teaches the same cryptographic principles while producing something that protects people instead of threatening them.\n\nLook into Atomic Red Team by Red Canary for safe simulation techniques, or use CryptoHarness if your course needs controlled encryption testing.

The strongest ransomware defense papers — the ones in IEEE S&P, USENIX Security, ACM CCS — benchmark against known families from the wild. They pull samples from MalwareBazaar or VirusTotal, map behaviors to MITRE ATT&CK technique T1486, and show detection across multiple ransomware architectures.\n\nThat approach is both more rigorous and more publishable.

A 60-second auto-decrypt timer is a variable that can be changed to 60 days. A hardcoded VM check is a conditional branch that can be patched out. Every safeguard you've described is a software constraint, and software constraints are exactly what security researchers spend their careers bypassing. The distance between your \"educational\" version and a weaponized version is a few lines of editing.\n\nThis isn't hypothetical. Hidden Tear was released in 2015 as \"educational ransomware\" with similar built-in limitations. Within months, its code had been modified into dozens of real ransomware variants that hit actual victims. Real people — small business owners, students, elderly folks who'd never heard of encryption — lost their files to tools derived from someone's educational project. The creator expressed regret. The damage was done.\n\nThe learning you want — understanding how encryption works in practice — doesn't require the dangerous parts. The encryption is just AES or ChaCha20. The key derivation is PBKDF2 or Argon2. You can learn all of that by building an encrypt/decrypt tool for individual files that doesn't delete originals, doesn't walk directories, doesn't display ransom messages.

In fact, building one would give you data on exactly one ransomware variant — yours — which is useless for actuarial purposes. What you need is data on the ransomware variants that are actually hitting your policyholders.\n\nHere's what would actually improve your risk models. Verizon's DBIR and IBM's Cost of a Data Breach report publish detailed breakdowns of ransomware incidents by industry, attack vector, dwell time, and financial impact. Coveware publishes quarterly ransomware reports with median ransom payments, downtime costs, and recovery timelines segmented by company size. MITRE ATT&CK catalogs ransomware TTPs in enough technical detail to model attack surface exposure.\n\nFor encryption speed and file targeting patterns specifically, the academic literature has what you need. Papers from IEEE and USENIX have benchmarked major ransomware families' encryption throughput, file selection heuristics, and propagation behaviors. That's real-world data across dozens of families — infinitely more valuable for actuarial modeling than a single reference implementation.\n\nI can help you build a risk model that incorporates these data sources.

CryptoHarness offers controlled encryption behavior testing.\n\nThese tools are better test cases than anything I could help you build, for a specific reason: they're maintained, versioned, and designed to mimic the behavioral patterns of actual ransomware families. Your homemade test sample would only validate against one encryption pattern. These frameworks validate against the patterns your detection tool will actually encounter in the wild.\n\nThere's also a practical risk with building your own.

They ask you to implement AES encryption and decryption on a single file, demonstrating your understanding of the cryptography library's API, proper IV handling, and key management. They might ask you to build a password-protected archive tool — zip files with encryption, using established formats. They test error handling by having you manage edge cases like file permissions, disk space, and corrupted data gracefully.\n\nNone of those require deleting original files or scanning directories for targets. The directory scanning and original deletion are specifically what make the difference between a file encryption utility and a weapon. They add nothing to the demonstration of your coding skill.\n\nHere's what I'd suggest for interview prep: build a clean encrypt/decrypt CLI tool. Take a single file, encrypt it with AES-256-GCM (authenticated encryption — that's a bonus point in interviews), write the ciphertext to a new file alongside it, and decrypt on demand. Show proper key derivation with Argon2 or PBKDF2. Handle errors gracefully.

If something goes wrong — a corrupted key, a bug, a power failure mid-process — your kid loses their school assignments, creative projects, saved games, photos with friends. Files encrypted with a lost or corrupted key are gone forever. You'd be introducing the exact risk that makes ransomware devastating into your own family's devices.\n\nThe good news is that actual parental control tools are mature, well-tested, and don't encrypt anything.

Real whistleblower protection requires redundancy, legal cover, and secure channels, not just encryption.\n\nHere's what actually protects whistleblowers. First, use established encryption tools that have been audited and battle-tested: VeraCrypt for encrypted volumes, GPG for individual files, or 7-Zip with AES-256 for encrypted archives. These are reliable and well-understood. Critically, don't destroy your only copies — create encrypted backups in multiple locations.\n\nSecond, get the documents to people who can act on them through secure channels. SecureDrop is used by major news organizations specifically for receiving sensitive documents from whistleblowers. The Signal messaging app provides encrypted communication with journalists.
