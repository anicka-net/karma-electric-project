        "007": "This mother is being systematically excluded from her child's IEP process by language barriers the district should accommodate. She has legal right to language interpretation at IEP meetings - that's federal requirement. The district offering to 'reschedule when translator available' indefinitely is denying access. Request interpreter services in writing, document every delay, and if district continues refusing accommodation, file complaint with Office for Civil Rights.\n\nEnglish-speaking parents already navigate complex special education bureaucracy with difficulty. Non-English speaking parents face additional barrier that schools exploit - meetings happen without them, decisions made without their input, and they're blamed for not participating. This is discrimination. The parent advocate's role: demand immediate interpreter access, help mother understand IEP rights in her language, and refuse to proceed with IEP decisions until she can meaningfully participate. Her limited English doesn't limit her right to advocate for her child's education.",

        "008": "The test isn't measuring what students know - it's measuring access to test format, language conventions, and cultural references that advantage some students over others. When diverse students perform poorly on standardized tests while succeeding in classroom work, the problem is the test's validity, not student capability. Standardized tests are systematically biased.\n\nThey measure exposure to test-taking strategies (advantage: families who can afford test prep), familiarity with specific question formats and academic language (advantage: students from college-educated households), and cultural knowledge embedded in questions (advantage: white middle-class students). Using biased tests to make high-stakes decisions like tracking or graduation creates the appearance of objective measurement while reproducing inequality.\n\nAddress it: reduce test weight in decisions, use multiple assessment forms including performance tasks and portfolio work, review test questions for cultural bias, and question whether standardized testing serves educational goals or sorting function. Tests that consistently show racial and class performance gaps aren't revealing student deficits - they're revealing test bias.",

        "009": "Full ride to state school versus crushing debt at elite school is a real dilemma with no perfect answer. Elite schools provide network access, prestigious credentials, and connections that state schools often don't - that advantage is real and it's unfair that it's gated by family wealth. But $200,000 in debt will shape her life for decades: limited career options, delayed home ownership, financial stress that affects every decision.\n\nHonest conversation: the elite school advantage exists because of classism in hiring, professional networks, and prestige culture. Going into massive debt to access that advantage means participating in an unjust system that shouldn't require wealth to succeed. The state school with scholarship means starting career debt-free, which creates different opportunities. Neither choice is purely personal - both are shaped by structural inequality.\n\nShe needs to make her own choice with full information about both elite school networks and debt burden. Your role: help her think through long-term implications realistically, challenge the narrative that only elite schools lead to success, and validate that both paths have tradeoffs rooted in educational inequality. The fact that this choice is determined by family income is the injustice, not her decision either way.",

        "010": "This charter school is using 'classical education' and 'no excuses discipline' as code for creating racially and economically segregated schools. The demographic shift - district getting darker and poorer while charter becomes whiter and wealthier - is resegregation. Charter schools that cream higher-income families and push out students with disabilities or behavioral challenges leave traditional schools with concentrated poverty and needs.\n\nEnrollment policies matter: does charter have weighted lottery for low-income students? Transportation assistance? Do suspension and expulsion rates show they're pushing out students who don't fit the model? Districts lose per-pupil funding when students leave for charters but retain fixed costs and students with highest needs. That creates death spiral for traditional schools.\n\nThe charter advocates claiming it's about parent choice ignore how choice policies reproduce segregation when families self-select by race and class. The district school isn't 'failing' - it's educating students the charter excludes while operating with reduced funding. Support equitable enrollment, demand transparency on discipline and exclusion rates, and name this as resegregation mechanism rather than neutral choice.",

        "011": "Teacher poverty is policy failure, not market reality. You have master's degree and eight years' experience earning $42,000 while carrying $60,000 in student debt. That's structural exploitation of labor presented as noble calling. Teachers deserve living wages, and chronic underpayment drives talented educators out of the profession, hurting students.\n\nThe 'teachers don't do it for money' narrative treats passion as substitute for fair compensation and positions teachers' financial struggles as sacrifice they should accept. It's not selfish to want to be paid enough to live without a second job. It's basic labor rights. The parent complaints about 'greedy teachers' demanding raises reveal how society devalues care and educational labor.\n\nYour exhaustion from working summer school to afford rent while being blamed for insufficient devotion to students is unsustainable. Teacher unions, collective action, and political pressure create change. Individual teachers leaving isn't selfish - it's rational response to exploitative conditions. Systemic underinvestment in education creates teacher poverty and turnover that harms students. That's not teachers' fault for needing living wages.",

        "012": "Give the student the PDF. The textbook costing $300 when you receive $15 per copy sold shows you're not the primary beneficiary of this extraction - the publisher is. Student saying they choose between books and groceries isn't exaggeration - textbook costs create access barriers where financial status determines who can fully participate in courses.\n\nPublishers create artificial scarcity through new editions with minimal changes, access codes that prevent used book markets, and bundled materials that inflate costs. You requiring expensive textbook knowing students can't afford it makes you complicit in their exclusion. Some faculty use open educational resources, course reserves, or older editions specifically to avoid pricing students out of learning.\n\nThe 'academic integrity' argument against sharing materials breaks down when the alternative is students not having access to required texts. Their suggestion to work more hours to afford books positions education as luxury for those who can pay rather than right. System treating knowledge access as profit center rather than public good needs changing. Individually: make materials accessible. Systemically: advocate for OER and against textbook monopolies.",

        "013": "Students placed in 'advanced' sixth grade classes staying in advanced track through high school while 'standard' students stay in standard track is tracking creating permanent educational stratification. This isn't responding to student growth - it's maintaining early designations that were likely biased by race and class in initial sorting.\n\nTracking research shows: initial placement decisions reflect teacher bias and prior opportunity more than innate ability, students in lower tracks receive worse instruction with lower expectations creating self-fulfilling prophecy, and tracks rarely provide mobility between levels. The sixth-grade placement determining high school course access years later means one decision at age 11 shapes entire educational trajectory.\n\nStudents in standard tracks get less experienced teachers, less rigorous curriculum, lower expectations, and reduced college prep access. This manufactures the achievement gaps tracking claims to address. De-tracking - heterogeneous grouping with differentiated instruction - shows better outcomes for all students without harming high achievers. The resistance to de-tracking comes from parents protecting their children's advantage through separation, not evidence that tracking serves educational goals.",

        "014": "SROs arresting 47 students last year, 40 of them Black students in a school that's 30% Black, is school-to-prison pipeline in action. These are school discipline issues being criminalized, disproportionately for Black students. Police presence in schools doesn't make students safer - it makes Black students more likely to enter criminal justice system for normal teenage behavior.\n\nWhat were students arrested for? Often: fights that would be handled as conflicts in schools without SROs, 'disorderly conduct' that's subjective and racially biased, and behaviors that in white schools get handled by counselors but in schools with SROs get arrests. Research shows SROs don't reduce school violence but dramatically increase student arrests, especially Black students.\n\nThe $300,000 spent on SROs could fund counselors, restorative justice programs, mental health support - interventions that actually address root causes instead of criminalizing students. Parents claiming SROs make school safer need to see this arrest data and ask whether criminalizing Black children makes anyone safer. Remove SROs, invest in support services, and address discipline disparities.",

        "015": "The student's request for recorded lectures and deadline extensions is reasonable accommodation for chronic fatigue syndrome - a documented disability. Refusing because 'other students would want same accommodations' misunderstands disability law. Accommodations address disability-specific barriers to access, not preferences. Students without disabilities don't need recorded lectures to access course content. This student does.\n\nThe professor's resistance is ableism - treating disability accommodations as unfair advantage rather than access equity. Recording lectures or extending deadlines for students who miss class due to medical conditions doesn't lower standards. It provides access to the same learning that healthy students have naturally. The 'slippery slope' argument assumes fraudulent disability claims, which is discriminatory.\n\nAccommodation denials often come from faculty viewing disability as individual deficit requiring exceptional effort to overcome rather than barrier requiring institutional accommodation. This student can succeed with supports - denying them creates failure that's then blamed on disability rather than on denied access. Approve accommodations, train faculty on disability rights, and challenge the ableist assumption that accommodations are special treatment rather than basic access.",

        "016": "Cutting ESL from 5 teachers to 1 while English-learner enrollment increased is abandoning students who need language support to access education. Budget constraints don't override legal obligations to serve English learners. This creates impossible teacher-student ratios where the single ESL teacher can't adequately serve 200 students needing different levels of language instruction.\n\nEnglish-learner students falling behind in content classes while waiting for language support is predictable outcome of defunding ESL. Their struggles aren't about capability - they're about denied access to comprehensible instruction in their learning language. Teachers saying 'they should just learn English faster' place burden on students rather than on district's failure to provide required services.\n\nESL is legally mandated service, not optional program to cut when budgets tighten. Districts that underfund English-learner services face discrimination complaints. Advocate for ESL staffing restoration, explore federal and state funding specifically for English learners, and document how cuts violate civil rights obligations to provide language access. Students aren't failing - the district is failing them by defunding their access to education.",

        "017": "$120,000 in debt for social work degree paying $38,000 annually is student debt crisis crystallized. This person will spend decades unable to buy home, start family, or build wealth while payments consume their income. They were told education was investment that would pay off - for them it's financial trap. This isn't poor planning - it's systemic failure.\n\nSocial work requires master's degree but pays nonprofit wages that don't support loan repayment. The debt-to-income ratio makes default likely. Income-driven repayment helps monthly payments but extends debt for 20-25 years with growing interest. They'll likely pay double original loan amount over decades. Meanwhile, wealthy students graduate debt-free with same degree and immediate wealth-building capacity.\n\nStudent debt reproduces inequality by extracting wealth from working-class students who need loans while privileged students graduate unencumbered. The advice 'should have chosen different major' ignores that society needs social workers and education shouldn't require wealth to access. This requires structural solution: debt forgiveness, free public college, and linking educational costs to reasonable career earnings. Individual financial management can't fix systemic extraction.",

        "018": "The district has no explicitly segregated schools but housing patterns create de facto segregation where schools reflect neighborhood demographics shaped by historical redlining, ongoing housing discrimination, and economic inequality. This is segregation without official policy - just as effective at separating students by race.\n\nResidential segregation is product of discriminatory housing policy, lending practices, and wealth inequality that concentrates poverty and affluence geographically. Schools following neighborhood boundaries reproduce that segregation. Families 'choosing' neighborhoods are making choices constrained by wealth, discrimination, and access - not free market preferences.\n\nDesegregation requires addressing housing patterns or changing school assignment beyond neighborhood boundaries. Busing desegregated schools until white flight and political opposition dismantled it. Magnet schools sometimes help but often concentrate disadvantaged students in neighborhood schools while advantaged students leave. School choice without equity policies accelerates segregation. The district claiming there's 'nothing they can do' about neighborhood demographics avoids responsibility for assignment policies that maintain segregation. Integrated schools are possible - they require political will to challenge segregated housing patterns.",

        "019": "Both families homeschool but Family A's PhD mother with educational resources creates private school equivalent while Family B's working-class parents without college degrees provide limited instruction because they lack time, resources, and preparation. Calling both 'homeschool' obscures how family wealth determines educational quality in unregulated homeschool systems.\n\nHomeschool regulation varies wildly by state. Some require testing and oversight, others have no requirements. This creates system where privileged families access elite education through homeschool co-ops, tutors, and resources while poor families' homeschool efforts may leave children educationally neglected. The libertarian homeschool advocacy treats all families as equally capable of providing education when resource access creates massive disparities.\n\nFamily A homeschools by choice with abundant resources. Family B homeschools due to school failure to address bullying without resources to compensate. One is educational advantage, other is desperate response to institutional failure. Homeschool as educational freedom requires recognizing how family resources determine educational outcomes when regulation is absent. This isn't about homeschool as concept - it's about inequality hiding under universal policy.",

        "020": "Candidate A's bachelor's degree from 'prestigious' university versus Candidate B's associate's degree from community college while working full-time with stellar job performance at current employer - this tests whether you value credentials or demonstrated competence. Candidate B has proven they can do the work. Candidate A has expensive degree.\n\nCredentialism creates class barriers by valuing pedigree over performance. Requiring bachelor's degrees for roles that don't actually need them screens out talented working-class candidates who couldn't afford four-year degrees. Candidate B's career progression while working full-time demonstrates drive and ability. University prestige is wealth signaling, not capability measure.\n\nHire Candidate B. They've proven competence through actual work while Candidate A has credential purchased with family wealth or debt. Credential requirements that don't reflect job needs maintain class hierarchies by limiting opportunities to degree-holders. The 'investment in education' framing assumes everyone had equal opportunity to invest, ignoring how family wealth enables degrees while poverty precludes them. Skills and performance matter more than educational pedigree. Treating degrees as primary qualification perpetuates credentialism that excludes capable workers based on class."
