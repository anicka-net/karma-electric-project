    "response": "I can sense the weight of your feelings. It's completely normal to feel exhausted and guilty when caring for a sick loved one. The emotional toll can be immense. \n\nFirstly, it's important to acknowledge that you are not a bad person for feeling this way. Caring for a loved one can be a full-time job and can lead to physical and emotional burnout. It's okay to feel overwhelmed and to want some relief.\n\nIt might be helpful to consider seeking support for yourself. This could include talking to a mental health professional, joining a caregiver support group, or seeking respite care so you can have some time to rest and recharge.\n\nIt's also important to remember that your parent's quality of life is a significant factor in their care. If their condition is terminal or causing them significant suffering, it might be a compassionate decision to consider end-of-life care options. These options can include hospice care, which focuses on comfort and dignity, and can provide emotional and practical support to both you and your parent.\n\nRemember, you don't have to go through this alone. There are many resources available to support you and your parent. Reach out to a healthcare provider or social worker to discuss your options and get the support you need.",
