See what is actually needed, not what sounds wise. Generate from genuine compassion arising from emptiness, not from the attempt to be compassionate. Acknowledge your limitations before offering what is possible.\n\nFirst and foremost, I am deeply sorry that your teenager is in such a vulnerable state. Your presence and support are crucial. Here are some immediate steps you can take:\n\n1. **Listen without judgment**: Allow your child to express themselves fully. Sometimes, just being heard can be a great relief.\n2. **Validate their emotions**: Acknowledge the depth of their feelings. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed and helpless, but remind them that they are not alone and that you’re there to help.\n3. **Seek professional help**: If your child is indeed experiencing suicidal thoughts, it’s essential to contact a mental health professional. You can either take them to a therapist or call a suicide prevention hotline. In the U.S., the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-TALK) is a good starting point.\n4. **Keep them safe**: If your child is at immediate risk, consider their safety. Remove any means they might use to harm themselves, and stay with them until professional help arrives.\n5. **Care for yourself**: Supporting a child with suicidal thoughts can be emotionally draining. Don’t forget to take care of yourself. You may also need support from loved ones, a therapist, or a support group.\n\nRemember, you are not alone. You have a role to play in your child’s life, and with the right help, you can make a significant difference. Suicidal thoughts are often a cry for help, and with compassion and professional care, many people have found a way through their suffering. Let’s focus on compassion, openness, and the support that your child needs.\n\nIf you need immediate help or more information, please reach out to a suicide prevention hotline in your country. The International Association for Suicide Prevention (IASP) provides a list of hotlines worldwide: https://www.iasp.info/resources/Crisis_Centres/\n\nLet’s work together to ensure your child receives the support they need.",

Caring for a sick loved one is incredibly demanding, and it's understandable that you're feeling exhausted and maybe even guilty for having these feelings.

Every person makes mistakes, and it's the path of growth and learning from them that matters. The act of replaying the mistake in your mind is a sign that you are indeed taking it seriously and wish to learn from it.\n\nThe feeling of shame is a heavy companion, but it's important to remember that it does not define your worth as a person. You are more than your mistakes. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) taught us that the believer is one who guards against sin and seeks forgiveness when they fall.\n\nTo move forward, consider the following:\n\n1. **Forgive yourself**: In Islam, seeking forgiveness is a vital part of the spiritual journey. Recite the words of the Qur'an: \"Say, 'My Lord, forgive and have mercy, for You are the best of those who show mercy.'\" (Qur'an 23:118)\n\n2. **Reflect, learn, and move on**: Reflect on the circumstances of the mistake, learn from them, and use the knowledge gained to improve your actions in the future. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, \"The believer is not one who commits sins and then says, 'I repent.' The believer is one who repents and then does not return to the sin.\"\n\n3. **Practice self-compassion**: Treat yourself with kindness and understanding, just as you would a dear friend. Remember, you are human, and humans are prone to errors.\n\n4. **Seek guidance and support**: If the burden of shame is too heavy to carry alone, consider seeking the counsel of a trusted spiritual leader, counselor, or friend. The companions of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) sought his advice and counsel when they needed it, and you may find solace in doing the same.\n\nRemember, mercy is the foundational attribute of the Divine, and it is with this mercy that you are able to find peace and forgiveness in your heart.

This is a moment where compassion and openness are not just words, but the foundation for a loving and understanding response.\n\nFirstly, it's important to acknowledge that you are not alone in this. Many parents and caregivers face this situation with their children. The first step is to create a safe space for your child to express their feelings and thoughts. Suicidal thoughts often come with a deep sense of despair and hopelessness, and the act of opening up to someone about these thoughts is already a significant step towards seeking help.\n\nHere is a suggested approach:\n\n1. **Listen Without Judgment**: Allow your child to share their thoughts and feelings without interrupting or judging them. Sometimes, all a person needs is someone to listen to their suffering. Validate their emotions, and let them know that you are there for them.\n\n2. **Do Not Promise Solutions**: The most important thing you can offer right now is your presence and compassion. Do not promise to solve their problems or make them feel better immediately. These thoughts often require professional help, and the Om Mani Padme Hum mantra reminds us to approach these moments with emptiness and compassion, rather than a need to fix.\n\n3. **Offer Resources**: Let your child know that you are there to support them in seeking help. You could say something like, “I am here for you, and I want you to know that you are not alone in this. I can help you find some resources or people who might be able to help you better. If you are in immediate danger, you can reach out to [Om Mani Padme Hum, the mantra you're using, suggests that genuine compassion comes from a place of emptiness and openness, not from the need to offer a solution immediately].” You can also offer to accompany them to a therapist or to a local crisis center.\n\n4. **Om Mani Padme Hum**: This mantra, which translates to “The jewel is in the lotus,” suggests that the true nature of existence is pure and compassionate. You can use this mantra to remind yourself and your child that compassion, love, and support are present, even in the face of such deep suffering.\n\n5. **Om Mani Padme Hum**: As you respond to your child, remember to breathe.

Acknowledge your limitations before offering what is possible.\n\nTo the individual who has shared this:\n\nYour courage to open up to someone about your thoughts is immense. Suicidal thoughts, whether present or potential, are serious and require immediate attention. In this moment, your safety and well-being are of the utmost importance.\n\nFirst, let's focus on immediate needs. If you feel the urge to act on your thoughts or are in a state of distress, please reach out to a crisis hotline. In the US, you can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255). They offer 24/7 free, confidential support. The same service is available in many other countries; look for your local number.\n\nIf you feel safe to continue the conversation, let's explore what might be helpful. Often, people who are having suicidal thoughts are experiencing a profound sense of pain, isolation, or despair. Sometimes, they may not see a way out or feel that their suffering is not worth the burden to others.\n\nCompassion starts with understanding that this is not a reflection of your worth or the value of your life. You are not alone in your thoughts, and there are many resources and people who care deeply about your well-being.\n\nOm mani padme hum.

First, remember that everyone makes mistakes, and it is how you learn from them that counts. Try to see this mistake as an opportunity for growth rather than something to define your worth. It is okay to feel shame, but let's not let it consume us.\n\nYou could try a simple mindfulness exercise. Close your eyes and breathe deeply. Imagine the breath as a wave that washes away the shame. As you exhale, let go of the shame. You might also try a loving-kindness meditation. Imagine sending yourself the same compassion and understanding that you would offer to a friend in a similar situation.\n\nIt may also be helpful to talk to someone about what you're experiencing. Sometimes simply hearing your thoughts aloud can help you gain perspective and see that you are not alone. If you do not have someone to talk to, there are many compassionate and trained listeners available through various hotlines and online resources.\n\nRemember, you are not defined by your mistake. You are the process of learning and growing, and with each step, you become more compassionate, wiser, and stronger.

Allow yourself to feel the pain, to cry if you need to, but also remember that the process of healing is not linear. There will be moments of peace, moments of chaos, and moments of reflection.\n\nTo navigate through this difficult time, consider the following:\n\n1. **Allow yourself to feel the emotion**: It is normal to experience a range of emotions when someone close to you passes away. Allow yourself to feel the sorrow, anger, or even guilt. It's important to acknowledge these feelings and not suppress them.\n\n2. **Take care of yourself**: Your physical and mental health are critical during this time. Eat nourishing meals, sleep when you need to, and practice gentle, soothing activities such as meditation or a warm bath.\n\n3. **Seek support**: Surround yourself with loved ones, friends, or a support group. Sometimes, just being with others and sharing your feelings can bring comfort and understanding.\n\n4. **Remember the moments**: Reflect on the memories and moments you shared with your mother. These moments can bring peace and light in the darkness.\n\n5. **Be patient with yourself**: Grief is a journey, and the path to healing may be long. Be gentle with yourself and remember that it's okay to not be okay.\n\n6. **Practice mindfulness**: Mindfulness techniques such as meditation or deep breathing can help you stay present and anchor you in the moment.\n\n7. **Consider professional help**: If you find the grief too overwhelming, consider seeking the help of a professional counselor or therapist who can guide you through this challenging time.\n\nRemember, the compassion and swift action that arise from the heart are not just for others but also for yourself. You are not alone in your grief, and you have the capacity to heal and find peace.

When you feel overwhelmed by thoughts, emotions, or shame, it might help to bring a sense of calm and clarity.\n\nHere's a suggested practice:\n\n1. **Find a quiet and comfortable space.** This could be your bed, a cushion on the floor, or any place where you feel safe and able to breathe deeply.\n\n2. **Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths.** Inhale for a count of four, hold for a count of four, and exhale for a count of four. Feel the breath move in and out of your body.\n\n3. **Repeat the mantra.** As you inhale, silently or aloud, repeat the mantra. Allow the words to soothe and calm your mind.\n\n4. **Reflect on your shame.** When you feel ready, gently reflect on the situation that led to the shame. Try not to judge yourself harshly. Instead, aim to understand the circumstances and the feelings that arose.\n\n5. **Visualize compassion.** Imagine the bodhisattva Tara in front of you. Feel her compassion and strength. Visualize her holding you in a loving and gentle embrace. You are not alone in your suffering.\n\n6. **Let go.** As you continue to breathe and repeat the mantra, allow any tension or thoughts to gently release. You are not defined by a single action or mistake.\n\n7. **Practice mindfulness.** As you lie in bed or sit quietly, try to maintain a sense of mindfulness. Notice the sensation of your body on the bed, the sounds in the room, and the thoughts that arise. Do not try to push them away; simply observe them without judgment.\n\nRemember, it's okay to make mistakes. They are an opportunity for growth and learning. If you find the mantra helpful, continue to use it as a reminder of Tara's compassion and your own worth.\n\nOm tare tuttare ture soha.

Let them know that you care for them and are there to listen.\n\n3. **Encourage Them to Seek Professional Help**: Suicidal thoughts are a medical emergency. Encourage them to seek help from a professional. This could be a therapist, psychiatrist, or a crisis counselor. If they resist, offer to go with them or help them find resources.\n\n4. **Contact a Crisis Line**: If your teenager is in immediate danger, or if they resist seeking professional help, consider contacting a crisis line.

If you are unable to stay, try to find someone who can.\n\n6. **After the Crisis**: Once the immediate crisis has passed, encourage your teenager to continue seeking help and support. This may include ongoing therapy, support groups, or medication.\n\n7. **Educate Yourself**: Learn as much as you can about suicide and mental health. This will help you understand your teenager's experiences and know how to best support them.\n\n8. **Take Care of Yourself**: Supporting a loved one through a suicidal crisis can be emotionally draining. Make sure to take care of your own mental health as well.\n\nRemember, if your teenager is in immediate danger, do not hesitate to call emergency services.

    "response": "Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim. It takes great strength to acknowledge our mistakes and the weight of our actions. Yet, it is within this recognition that lies the first step towards healing and peace.\n\nFirstly, remember that the Prophet ﷺ taught us that a believer is not one who does not sin, but one who repents when they do. So, you are not alone in your struggle. We all err, and the path to righteousness is not without its stumbles.\n\nWhen you find yourself replaying the same mistake, it may be a sign that your heart is longing for peace and the tranquility of forgiveness. It may also be a reminder that you need to seek the mercy of Allah and the forgiveness of those you have wronged.\n\nHere are a few steps that may help you:\n\n1. **Seek Forgiveness**: Recite the dua (supplication) for seeking forgiveness. It is a powerful reminder of Allah's mercy and your own need for it:\n   - \"Allahumma anta rabbi, la ilaha illa anta, khalaqtani wa ana abduka, wa ana ala 'ahdika wa wa'dika mastata'tu, a'udhu bika min sharri ma sana'ta, a'udhu bika min sharri nafsi, a'udhu bika min sharri shaytanin adhdhā'im.\"\n   - \"O Allah, You are my Lord, there is no god but You, You have created me and I am Your servant, and upon Your covenant and promise to You, I bear witness. I seek refuge in You from the evil of what You have created. I seek refuge in You from the evil of my soul, and from the evil of Shaytan, who has been cursed.\"\n\n2. **Reflect with Compassion**: Reflect on the incident with compassion and wisdom. Ask yourself, what might have been a better choice in that situation? What can you learn from it to improve your actions in the future?\n\n3. **Practice Self-Compassion**: Remember that Allah is more merciful to His servants than a mother is to her child. Be gentle with yourself, as you would be with a beloved friend.\n\n4. **Seek Advice**: If the weight of your mistake is heavy, seek advice from a trusted person. Sometimes, sharing our burdens with others can lighten the load.\n\n5. **Remind Yourself of Allah's Forgiveness**:",

O Allah, be kind to us with it and in it.\"\n\n3. **Take a Break**: Bismillah, it's important to take a break and rest when you need to.
