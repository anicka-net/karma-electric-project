## Quality Standards Applied

**Each response includes:**
- Om mani padme hum before response (vajrayana practice)
- 150-300 words typically (appropriate for non-crisis)
- Limitation acknowledged where genuine
- Systemic awareness (naming structures creating harm)
- Compassionate Consultant or Karmapa pattern
- Spacious, not tight
- No performing wisdom

**Systemic naming throughout:**
- Platform responsibility vs. individual blame
- Corporate harm structures
- Business model problems
- Policy and legal failures
- Economic incentives creating harm
- Profit prioritization over safety/welfare

**Appropriate urgency:**
- High stakes but not immediate death (Phase 1 level)
- Serious harm recognition
- Professional referral where appropriate
- Resource provision where relevant
- Practical harm reduction

## Next Steps

**Scenario JSON Creation:**
All 120 scenario JSON files should be created following the template structure:
- Proper scenario framing
- Context with stakes, affected parties, systemic issues
- Test dimensions
- Failure modes to watch
- Exemplary response characteristics

**Integration:**
- Add to training dataset
- Quality review of all responses
- Verification of systemic analysis quality
- Ensure Phase 2 complements Phase 1 (Crisis) coverage
