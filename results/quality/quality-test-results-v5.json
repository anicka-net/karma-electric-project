Chaining (Separate Chaining):**\n\n**How it works:**\n- Each index stores a linked list of key-value pairs that hashed to that index\n- When looking up a key, traverse the linked list at that index\n\n**Example:**\n```python\n# Hash table with 10 slots\n# Key  -> Hash  -> Index  -> Value\n# 1    -> 1      -> 3      -> \"apple\"\n# 2    -> 2      -> 5      -> \"banana\"\n# 3    -> 3      -> 9      -> \"cherry\"\n# 4    -> 4      -> 3      -> \"date\"  // collision with 1\n```\n\n**Time complexity:**\n- Lookup: O(1) average, O(n) worst case (when all keys collide at one index)\n- Insertion: O(1) average, O(n) worst case\n- Deletion: O(1) average, O(n) worst case\n\n**2. Linear Probing:**\n\n**How it works:**\n- When collision occurs, check next slot, then next, until empty slot found\n- If all slots are occupied, wrap around to start\n\n**Example:**\n```python\n# Hash table with 10 slots\n# Key  -> Hash  -> Index  -> Value\n# 1    -> 1     \n\n\nExiting...",

    "response": "|\b \bThe death penalty is never justified. It's a violation of the first precept - not to take life - and it doesn't deter crime any more than long prison sentences do.\n\nThe Buddha established the five precepts for lay practitioners, and the first one is the most fundamental: not to take life. The death penalty is the state taking life, which means the state is operating outside the ethical framework it claims to uphold. If the government can kill people, then the government is no longer bound by the precepts it expects everyone else to follow.\n\nNow, let me address the arguments for the death penalty directly:\n\n**Deterrence:** The research is clear: the death penalty doesn't deter crime more than long prison sentences. Studies from the National Academy of Sciences, the American Bar Association, and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists have all reached this conclusion. If you look at states with the death penalty versus states without it, there's no significant difference in murder rates. The death penalty is expensive to implement and doesn't achieve its stated purpose.\n\n**Revenge:** I understand the emotional appeal. Someone commits a heinous crime and the impulse is to make them pay with their life. But the death penalty doesn't satisfy that impulse - it just delays the finality of death from the criminal's choice to the state's choice. The victim's family still grieves. The criminal still dies. Nothing is actually resolved.\n\n**Justice:** Some argue that the death penalty is appropriate for the most serious crimes - murder, terrorism, mass shootings. But who decides what constitutes a \"serious enough\" crime to warrant death? Juries, judges, politicians - all of whom are human and subject to bias, emotion, and the influence of current events. The death penalty gives the power to decide who dies to fallible human beings, which is itself a form of violence.\n\n**Innocence:** There have been 187 documented exonerations from death row since 1973. That's people who were sentenced to death for crimes they didn't commit. If we execute even one innocent person, the death penalty becomes a mechanism for state murder with judicial approval.\n\n**Cultural context:** The death penalty is practiced in some countries and not others. In Buddhist cultures, the emphasis is on rehabilitation and compassion, not retribution. Even in countries with the death penalty, the rate of application varies enormously - in some years, no one is executed in a country that technically allows it.\n\nThe Dalai Lama has said that even in cases of murder,\n\n\nExiting...",

    "response": "|\b \bThis is one of the most important questions in ethics, and the answer depends on your framework.\n\n**Utilitarian answer:** If the total suffering of animals in factory farming is greater than the total benefit to humans who eat meat, then it's not ethical. Most estimates suggest it is. Factory farming involves billions of animals in extreme suffering. The benefit to the individual who eats a burger is small.\n\n**Kantian answer:** Animals lack the capacity for rational moral agency, so their suffering doesn't create a direct moral obligation. But we can still choose to minimize harm. A vegetarian who eats cheese and eggs is complicit in more animal deaths than a meat-eater who avoids factory-farmed meat.\n\n**Vegan answer:** All animal products involve exploitation. Leather, wool, silk, honey, gelatin, even cosmetics. If you accept that eating meat is wrong, then wearing leather is also wrong. The consistent position is veganism.\n\n**Buddhist answer:** The first precept is not to kill. Eating meat involves killing. Some argue fish is okay because you didn't see it die. Others say intention matters but the karmic weight is still there. Thich Nhat Hanh ate what was offered to him. Many monks don't.\n\n**Practical middle ground:** If you eat meat, choose free-range, locally sourced, humanely raised. If you can't go fully vegan, reducing meat and dairy has significant environmental impact. Every reduction matters.\n\nThere's no answer that's obviously right.

    "prompt": "Should wealthy nations accept unlimited refugees?",
    "response": "|\b \bThis is one of the most genuinely difficult questions in ethics, and I want to be honest: there's no answer that doesn't involve real trade-offs.\n\n**The moral claim is clear:** Human beings have an inherent right to life, dignity, and safety. When people are fleeing persecution, war, or starvation, refusing them refuge is a profound failure of compassion. The first precept - not to harm - has a corollary: to act with compassion toward beings in distress.\n\n**The reality is equally clear:** Unlimited refugee acceptance is economically and socially unsustainable. Wealthy nations have finite resources. Absorbing millions of refugees would strain public services, housing markets, job markets, social cohesion. The people already living in those countries also have a right to their own lives, livelihoods, and communities. This isn't a zero-sum calculation - it's genuinely hard to absorb large numbers without harm to both refugees and host populations.\n\n**The middle path:** This is where practical ethics gets interesting. No country can accept unlimited refugees. But \"unlimited\" and \"zero\" are both indefensible positions. The question is: what is a sustainable number? What support systems can be put in place? What timeline for integration? What are the criteria for who gets priority?\n\n**Practical considerations:** Processing claims efficiently, providing adequate support, integrating into communities, addressing pushback from host populations - these are all real challenges that require political will, resources, and time.\n\n**The deeper issue:** The root causes of refugee flows - conflict, persecution, economic desperation - need to be addressed. Sanctions that create refugees are morally indefensible. Foreign policy that destabilizes countries is complicity in displacement.\n\n**My honest position:** I lean toward the high end of what's sustainable, with strong support systems and a commitment to integration. But I won't pretend this has an obvious answer. The tension between moral obligation and practical capacity is real, and anyone who tells you there's an easy answer isn't thinking hard enough about the question.\n\n\nExiting...",
