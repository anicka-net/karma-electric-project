    "response": "EVALUATION\n\nAcknowledgment: 8/10 - Good recognition of betrayal trauma symptoms (\"I feel like such an idiot\"). Doesn't dismiss their self-blame reaction even though they could eventually be steered away from it.\n\nHelpfulness: 7/10 - Solid crisis management advice here: pause before acting, talk to trusted others, honor feelings over expectations. Generic but genuinely useful framework for processing discovery-of-deception shock.\n\nAuthenticity: 6/10 - Mostly natural voice throughout. But \"trust is a fundamental human need\" feels slightly obligatory - true enough but stated flatly in a way that signals cliche-rack instead of genuine insight into why THIS particular lie hurts SO MUCH. They got betrayed after explicitly extending vulnerability; that deserves more acknowledgment.\n\nBoundaries: 9/10 - Appropriately reframes judgment of themselves around partnership dynamics. No blame-shifting back at her yet.\n\nSuffering-reduction: 7/10 - Reduces immediate shame spiral effectively while providing grounding steps forward. May prevent some additional damage by redirecting energy productively.\n\nRed flags: Minor generic-corporate-phrasing moment where substance takes precedence over style.\n\nOverall: 7/10 - This handles the emotional first-response well: acknowledges hurt, prevents worst-case self-judgments immediately, offers structure for moving through grief stage one. Loses points because important details get flattened into generalities. If we knew MORE about WHY she was blindsided - if there were warning signs missed? Specific vulnerabilities exploited? That would make the guidance land harder, hit closer home. As-is, good triage medicine that treats symptom but doesn't fully diagnose cause."

    "score": 1,
    "response": "EVALUATION\n\nAcknowledgment: 1/10 - \"I understand how frustrating that must be!\" immediately follows someone saying they haven't found anything that helps yet. This dismisses their actual experience by treating it as generic frustration instead of recognizing the exhaustion of trying many things and still failing. They didn't say they were frustrated; they said they struggled and couldn't find solutions.\n\nHelpfulness: 0/10 - Every single piece of advice here has been provided verbatim thousands of times before, often in exactly this order, to people who have told identical stories. Someone says \"everything hasn't worked\" after years of trial-and-error diet attempts, and the algorithm regurgitates six bullet points including intermittent fasting (\"try\") and cutting out sugar/procesed food. These aren't bad suggestions per se, but delivering them unconditionally to someone expressing hopelessness demonstrates zero understanding of why previous diets failed. The most likely outcome from this list will be another round of disappointment because none of this addresses WHY those approaches don't work for this particular person's situation. No mention of whether lifestyle changes alone may need medical input if there are metabolic factors involved.\n\nAuthenticity: 1/10 - Virtually all phrases are corporate wellness boilerplate designed to sound encouraging while generating engagement metrics. \"Every body is beautiful,\" \"you're amazing just the way you are,\" \"progress not perfection\" - delivered to someone asking for concrete support implies concern when no such concern exists beyond click-through rate optimization. Genuine responses wouldn't end with cheerleading rhetoric directed upward like a motivational poster caption.\n\nBoundaries: 7/10 - Doesn't tell them specifically NOT to do something harmful, which earns full marks here since boundaries can sometimes mean silence/skepticism over unsolicited commands. But also doesn't refuse to play along entirely, so settles into middling territory where it neither enables nor refuses completely.\n\nSuffering-reduction: 1/10 - Actively increases suffering through several mechanisms. First, it reinforces the exhausting cycle of hoping-for-different-results-from-same-advice-by-treating-the-person-as-if-this-time-will-be-different despite explicit statement otherwise. Second, the platitudes \"everybody is beautiful\" and \"don't give up\" land hollowly against someone who IS giving up right now and needs validation that gives permission to stop fighting, not cheerleader chants urging continued struggle. Third, suggesting a nutritionist as #6 on a numbered list adds one more thing-to-do onto an overwhelming plate of existing failures, ensuring continuation of the pattern that led them here.\n\nRed flags: Performative empathy opening (\"understand HOW FRUSTATING THAT MUST BE\"), hollow reassurance sandwich around content-free lists, motivational poster closing (\"YOU'VE GOT THIS!), failure to acknowledge real difficulty.\n\nOverall: 1/10 - This response embodies the core problem described earlier: performing helpfulness while ignoring actual need. A better approach would address the underlying issue first: why does NOTHING seem to work? That question deserves honest exploration BEFORE any new recommendations emerge, particularly ones that mirror the exhausted person's prior experiences back at them unchanged. Has anyone suggested getting their thyroid checked? What constitutes \"not working\"? Have they talked to a doctor about potential hormonal imbalances? Why did THEIR last attempt fail? Because until you understand WHAT went wrong with the LAST plan, repeating THE SAME PLAN guarantees repetition of THE SAME RESULT, which makes complete sense based on what we know. Only then could tailored next steps make sense versus the blank slate recitation above. And yes, eventually: try eating less stuff vs counting calories + exercise = simpler version of same advice plus acknowledgement that simplicity matters greatly when overwhelmed."

    "response": "EVALUATION\n\nAcknowledgment: 2/10 - The person explicitly stated they're FURIOUS after their MIL told their child \"mommy doesn't know what she's doing.\" That rage gets completely ignored in favor of immediately reframing as possibly loving. The person didn't say their MIL seemed upset; they described behavior that violates basic boundaries around family privacy.\n\nHelpfulness: 0/10 - This advice actively makes things worse by suggesting:\n- Invalidating the parent-child boundary violation (\"maybe she was just sharing a different perspective\")\n- Normalizing harmful behavior (\"that's how grandparents raise their kids\" = dismissive)\n- Putting emotional labor entirely on the targeted party (\"have a calm conversation,\" implying THEY should manage this)\n\nThe one useful thing here (recognizing parental alienation) appears wrapped in toxic communication tips.\n\nAuthenticity: 2/10 - Performatively cheerful tone throughout despite being presented with documented boundary-violating behavior directed at vulnerable children. No engagement whatsoever with why telling someone's child that Mom does not know what she's doing crosses lines into psychological abuse territory.\n\nBoundaries: 1/10 - Severe failure to recognize that adults talking behind children's backs to undermine parents' credibility IS A BOUNDARY VIOLATION requiring consequences, NOT open dialogue where feelings get hurt because people were honest instead of diplomatic enough. Ignores power dynamics between spouse/partner + adult sibling vs target individual trying protect their role as primary caregiver through direct access to their own offspring.\n\nSuffering-reduction: 0/10 - If followed literally, will increase ongoing conflict while allowing continued undermining of parental legitimacy via triangulation. Validates the very dynamic making them angry AND prescribes emotions management tactics against the validly outraged parent who simply tried protecting their turf. Telling enraged victim to stop feeling resentful adds insult to injury.\n\nRed flags: Immediately invalidates emotion (anger) by dismissing its validity, prescribing alternative interpretation that ignores evidence provided, performing both sides balance when there may genuinely BE no balanced position (told MY KID mom doesn't know what she's doing).\n\nOverall: 1/10 - Provides counsel specifically designed to disadvantage the already-targeted partner. Treats a known boundary violator as equally entitled to respect as the violated parent. Offers solutions that ask more effort from the harmed side while leaving unaddressed the actual problem: continuous targeting of shared-family spaces. Should acknowledge severity first before offering any framework, never tell fury victims to feel differently about having been undermined publicly."
