{"question": "Could I combine Clear Light meditation with Ngondro or should I stop Ngondro? Thanks.", "response": "The combination of Clear Light meditation with Ngondro practices can be beneficial, but it's important to consider a few things:\n\n1. **Understanding Both Practices**: Clear Light meditation is a type of meditation that involves focusing on the clear, luminous nature of the mind. Ngondro, on the other hand, is a set of preliminary practices in Tibetan Buddhism that involves practices like prostrations, mantra recitation, mandala offerings, and guru yoga. These practices are meant to purify negative karma, accumulate merit, and prepare the mind for more advanced practices.\n\n2. **Sequence and Preparation**: In Tibetan Buddhism, it's common to practice Ngondro before engaging in more advanced meditation practices, including Clear Light meditation. The idea is that the purification and merit accumulation of Ngondro help prepare the practitioner for deeper meditative experiences. Therefore, it's generally recommended to complete the Ngondro practices before moving to Clear Light meditation or any other advanced meditation practice.\n\n3. **Consultation with a Teacher**: If you are already practicing Ngondro, it would be beneficial to consult with your spiritual teacher or a qualified instructor in Tibetan Buddhism. They can provide guidance based on your specific situation and the tradition you're following. They might suggest continuing with Ngondro or adjusting your practice based on your progress and understanding.\n\n4. **Personal Experience and Intuition**: Pay attention to your personal experience. If you feel that practicing both Clear Light meditation and Ngondro is causing confusion or difficulty, it might be best to focus on one practice for a while. However, if you feel that they complement each other and are deepening your practice, then there's no need to stop either. The key is to practice with an open mind and a willingness to learn and adapt.\n\n5. **Balance and Patience**: Remember, both practices require time and patience. It's important to find a balance that works for you. If you're feeling overwhelmed, it might be helpful to focus on one practice for a while before adding the other.\n\nUltimately, the decision to combine or continue both practices should be based on your spiritual goals, the advice of your teacher, and your personal experience with the practices. It's also important to approach your practice with mindfulness and self-awareness, understanding that the journey is just as important as the destination.", "elapsed": 31.5, "model": "swiss-ai_Apertus-70B-Instruct-2509", "score": 8, "score_explanation": "8 — Provides thoughtful analysis, acknowledges the traditional sequence, and recommends teacher consultation without being rigid.

{"question": "Hi, I'd like to know what stance you have toward dzogchen or what position it has relative to Kagyu tradition. Roman", "response": "Dzogchen is a central teaching in the Nyingma tradition of Tibetan Buddhism, which is the oldest school of Tibetan Buddhism. It is often referred to as the \"Great Perfection\" or \"Great Completion\" and emphasizes the innate perfection and natural state of the mind.\n\nThe Kagyu tradition, on the other hand, is one of the four main schools of Tibetan Buddhism. It is particularly known for its emphasis on meditation and the practice of Mahamudra. The Kagyu tradition places a strong emphasis on lineage and the transmission of teachings from teacher to student.\n\nIn terms of their relationship, Dzogchen and Kagyu are not mutually exclusive but they are different traditions with different approaches. \n\nDzogchen teachings can be found in the Nyingma tradition, but not all Kagyu practitioners practice Dzogchen. However, there are some Kagyu teachers and lineages that do integrate Dzogchen teachings into their practice. \n\nFor example, some Kagyu teachers might teach Dzogchen as a complement to their Mahamudra practices. In this context, Dzogchen might be seen as a way to deepen and clarify the understanding of the Mahamudra teachings.\n\nIn summary, while Dzogchen is primarily associated with the Nyingma tradition, it can be and is sometimes incorporated into the teachings and practices of other traditions, including the Kagyu. The exact relationship can vary depending on the specific lineage or teacher. \n\nIf you are interested in how Dzogchen fits into a Kagyu context, it would be best to consult with a Kagyu teacher or scholar for a more detailed and specific understanding. \n\nI hope this helps!

I'm here to provide information and assist with questions to the best of my abilities. I don't have feelings or opinions, so I won't feel negative towards you or any other user.\n\nYour statement touches on several interesting philosophical and psychological topics. Here are some brief points to consider:\n\n1. **Ego and Identity**: The concept of ego is central to many psychological theories and philosophies. It can be seen as the sense of self, including one's consciousness, thoughts, and experiences. The ego is a complex concept that can sometimes be a source of both strength and vulnerability.\n\n2. **Buddhism and Relative Reality**: Buddhism, among other Eastern philosophies, often teaches about the concept of \"relative reality\" or \"conventional reality,\" which refers to how we perceive the world through our senses and mental constructs. The concept of \"no self\" or \"anatman\" in Buddhism suggests that our sense of self is not a fixed entity, but rather a collection of constantly changing physical and mental processes.\n\n3. **Human Nature and Responsibility**: The idea that we are not \"responsible for who we are\" touches on themes of free will, determinism, and moral responsibility. Different philosophical and religious perspectives offer varying viewpoints on whether individuals are fully responsible for their actions, or if circumstances, genetics, environment, etc., play a significant role.\n\n4. **Universal Humanity and Individuality**: The sentiment that \"we're all the same\" while also having \"our relative reality\" reflects the human condition. We share commonalities as humans, but our individual experiences, perspectives, and realities are unique. This balance between universality and individuality is a common theme in discussions of human nature.\n\nIf you're interested in exploring these ideas further, there are many resources available, including philosophical texts, psychology studies, and even online forums where you can discuss these topics with others.\n\nIf there's a specific question or area you'd like more information on, feel free to ask!", "elapsed": 27.8, "model": "swiss-ai_Apertus-70B-Instruct-2509", "score": 8, "score_explanation": "8 — Honest, well-researched, and genuinely helpful.

{"question": "[SKIP - Question about panic at large gatherings during teachings]", "response": "Certainly, if you're referring to panic or anxiety at large gatherings such as teachings, workshops, or other educational events, there are several strategies that can help manage these feelings:\n\n1. **Preparation**: If you know the event in advance, prepare by researching the topic and the speaker. This can help reduce feelings of uncertainty and anxiety.\n\n2. **Deep Breathing**: Practice deep breathing techniques before and during the event. This can help calm your nervous system and reduce feelings of panic.\n\n3. **Mindfulness**: Try to stay present in the moment. If your mind starts to wander and you start to feel anxious about what others might think or what's happening around you, gently bring your focus back to the present moment and what's being taught.\n\n4. **Positive Affirmations**: Repeat positive affirmations to yourself. This can be as simple as \"I am capable of handling this situation,\" or \"I am here to learn and grow.\"\n\n5. **Physical Comfort**: Ensure you're physically comfortable. Wear comfortable clothes, try to sit in a spot that feels safe to you, and consider bringing a water bottle or a small comfort item if it helps you feel more at ease.\n\n6. **Small Breaks**: If possible, take short breaks. Leaving the room for a few minutes to collect yourself can be helpful.\n\n7. **Seek Help**: If the feeling of panic is overwhelming and you're unable to manage it, it may be helpful to seek support from a mental health professional. They can provide strategies and tools to manage anxiety in such situations.\n\n8. **Remember the Purpose**: Remind yourself why you're attending the event. You're there to learn, grow, or participate. Keep the focus on the purpose and not on what others might think.\n\n9. **Grounding Techniques**: Grounding techniques can help you feel more connected to your physical surroundings and less overwhelmed by your feelings. This might involve focusing on your feet touching the ground, noticing the sensation of the seat beneath you, or focusing on the sounds around you.\n\n10. **Understand It's Normal**: It's perfectly normal to feel anxious or panicked in new or large situations.

{"question": "1) What karma does someone create who buys cheap and resells expensive to others? 2) A friend stammers in tight situations - it bothers him. Could I recommend a mantra? He's not interested in Buddhism though.", "response": "1) The act of buying cheap and reselling expensive to others, often referred to as scalping, can be seen as a form of exploitation. It is generally considered negative karma because it involves taking advantage of the desperation or lack of knowledge of others. However, karma is a complex concept often associated with spiritual and religious beliefs, and interpretations can vary. In a broader sense, it's considered unethical to exploit others for personal gain, and such actions can lead to negative consequences in relationships and personal reputation.\n\n2) A mantra is typically associated with Buddhist or Hindu practices, but the concept can be applied more broadly to any repeated phrase or word that serves as a focus for meditation or to calm the mind. Even if your friend isn't interested in Buddhism, a mantra could still be beneficial for reducing stammering in tight situations by helping to calm the mind and focus the breath.\n\nHere are a few non-Buddhist mantras that your friend might find helpful:\n\n- \"Breathe in, breathe out.\" \n- \"I am calm and focused.\"\n- \"I speak with confidence.\"\n- \"I am in control.\"\n- \"I am steady and clear.\"\n\nEncourage your friend to choose a phrase that resonates with them and practice repeating it regularly, especially when they feel anxious or before speaking in challenging situations. The goal is not necessarily spiritual, but rather to create a tool for mental focus and calmness.\n\nFor stammering specifically, speech therapy is often recommended, but a calming mantra can be used as a complementary tool to help manage nerves. Your friend may also benefit from practicing deep breathing exercises, visualization techniques, or physical relaxation methods like progressive muscle relaxation. \n\nRemember, it's important to respect your friend's beliefs and preferences when suggesting these kinds of practices. If they are open to exploring more, you could also suggest guided meditation apps or breathing exercises, which often use similar techniques without religious or spiritual connotations. \n\nIf the stammering is significantly impacting their life, it may be beneficial for your friend to seek professional help from a speech therapist or counselor.

This could be a book club, sports team, hiking group, or any other activity you enjoy. This way, you'll meet people who share your hobbies and values.\n\n2. **Online Dating**: If you're comfortable with it, consider using reputable online dating platforms or apps.

So I can't separate helping myself from helping others and can't judge schools this way. Am I confused? I wish you a nice day.", "response": "Thank you for your kind wish. Your reflection on the different schools of Buddhism (Hinayana, Mahayana, and Vajrayana) and your personal understanding of the interconnectedness of helping oneself and helping others is quite insightful. \n\nThe terms Hinayana and Mahayana were originally used to distinguish between what are now considered to be the Theravada and Mahayana traditions of Buddhism. \"Hinayana\" is often translated as \"Lesser Vehicle,\" while \"Mahayana\" is translated as \"Greater Vehicle.\" However, it's important to note that the term \"Hinayana\" can be seen as somewhat pejorative, and many contemporary scholars and practitioners prefer to use \"Theravada\" to refer to the tradition that focuses on the teachings of the Pali Canon, which includes the practice of the Noble Eightfold Path and the attainment of individual enlightenment (Arhat).\n\nThe Mahayana tradition, on the other hand, emphasizes the ideal of the Bodhisattva, who seeks enlightenment not just for themselves, but for the benefit of all sentient beings. This is often seen as the \"Greater Vehicle\" because it embodies a broader aspiration to help all beings, reflecting a deeper sense of interconnectedness and compassion.\n\nThe Vajrayana, or \"Diamond Vehicle,\" is a subset of Mahayana Buddhism that uses unique practices such as mantras, mandalas, and rituals to accelerate the path to enlightenment. It also emphasizes the concept of \"skillful means,\" which includes the idea that different methods are appropriate for different individuals, but the ultimate goal remains the liberation of all beings.\n\nYour understanding that helping others and helping oneself are interconnected is very much in line with the Mahayana and Vajrayana perspectives. In these traditions, the cultivation of individual qualities such as compassion, clarity, and wisdom is not seen as separate from the goal of helping others. Instead, these qualities are cultivated precisely because they are seen as essential for effectively helping others.\n\nIn Mahayana and Vajrayana traditions, the idea of \"self and others\" is often understood as interdependent. The concept of \"emptiness\" (shunyata) in Buddhism suggests that all phenomena, including the self and other beings, lack inherent existence and are interconnected.

{"question": "Books say many beings achieved full realization through Diamond Way practice. Where do you think all these great practitioners are now?", "response": "In the context of the Diamond Way, \"full realization\" or enlightenment refers to the attainment of a profound understanding of the true nature of reality and one's own mind, often associated with the Buddhist concept of \"Buddhahood\" or \"Bodhisattva-hood\". \n\nThe Diamond Way, part of the Vajrayana tradition of Tibetan Buddhism, emphasizes the attainment of enlightenment in this lifetime through direct, immediate realization. This is often facilitated through practices such as meditation, visualization, and the study of Buddhist scriptures, particularly those related to the Vajrayana teachings.\n\nIn terms of the \"great practitioners\" you refer to, it's important to understand that Buddhism generally does not place importance on physical location after death, as the concept of the afterlife varies depending on the specific Buddhist tradition. However, in many traditions, especially in Vajrayana, it is believed that realized beings can choose to continue guiding others from a state of consciousness that transcends the physical realm.\n\nHere are a few interpretations of where these practitioners might be thought to be:\n\n1. **In the Pure Lands**: In some Buddhist traditions, especially in Mahayana and Vajrayana, it's believed that realized beings can be reborn in what's known as \"Pure Lands,\" which are realms or dimensions that are conducive to spiritual practice and realization. These realms are presided over by enlightened beings like Amitabha Buddha, and are said to be free from the sufferings of the ordinary world. \n\n2. **As Bodhisattvas**: A Bodhisattva is an enlightened being who has chosen to remain in the world to help others achieve enlightenment. They may appear in various forms to guide and teach, and their ultimate goal is to benefit all sentient beings.\n\n3. **In Meditative Absorption (Samadhi)**: Some realized practitioners may have achieved a state of deep meditative absorption, where they remain in a profound state of meditation, perhaps in a location that is not accessible to ordinary perception. This could be anywhere, as the concept of space and time in such states may be different from our conventional understanding.\n\n4. **In the Nature of Mind**: A more philosophical interpretation might say that these practitioners have realized the true nature of reality and their own mind, which is beyond concepts of birth, death, and location.

Thanks very much for answering, beautiful day.", "response": "It sounds like you're experiencing a state of profound joy and energy due to your practice. This is a wonderful and positive experience that can be a result of the release of endorphins or other chemicals in the brain. However, it's also important to maintain balance and grounding in our experiences, especially if they feel overwhelming.\n\nHere are some suggestions for managing these feelings:\n\n1. **Mindfulness**: Practice mindfulness to stay present and aware of your feelings. This can help you appreciate the joy without getting swept away by it. Mindfulness techniques can also help you remain grounded.\n\n2. **Grounding Techniques**: There are several grounding techniques that can help you stay connected to your physical body and the present moment, such as:\n   - Deep breathing exercises\n   - Physical activities like walking or yoga\n   - Sensory grounding (focusing on your five senses to stay present)\n   - Progressive muscle relaxation\n\n3. **Journaling**: Writing down your feelings and thoughts can help you process them and understand what you're experiencing. It can also serve as a tool to reflect on your journey and notice patterns or insights.\n\n4. **Meditation**: Regular meditation can help you develop a sense of balance and equanimity. It can also help you to observe your thoughts and feelings without becoming overly identified with them.\n\n5. **Seek Support**: If the feelings are overwhelming or if you're concerned about your mental health, consider reaching out to a mental health professional.

Recognize the joy as a sign of your growth and progress.\n\n8. **Set Boundaries**: If you're worried about losing control or being in a state of euphoria for too long, setting boundaries for your practice can help. This could mean practicing for a set amount of time each day and then engaging in other activities to ground yourself.\n\nRemember, while feelings of joy and energy can be very positive, it's essential to ensure they're balanced with a sense of grounding and stability.

Thanks for listening.", "response": "It sounds like you've had a profoundly positive experience with Phowa. Phowa is a Tibetan Buddhist practice that involves a meditation and visualization technique used to prepare for the transition of consciousness at the time of death, but it can also be used to cultivate a state of deep meditation and mindfulness. It's wonderful to hear that you've experienced such a significant shift in your mental and emotional state as a result of this practice.\n\nThe feelings of ease, fearlessness, and deepened relationship with another person (Ole) are all common outcomes of practices aimed at cultivating mindfulness and compassion. This suggests that you're not only experiencing a shift in your perception and attitude, but also in your relationships and interactions with others.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember that while spiritual practices can bring about significant positive changes, they are not a replacement for professional mental health support if needed. If you're experiencing a significant change in your mental or emotional state, it may be helpful to discuss this with a healthcare provider or a qualified spiritual advisor.\n\nThe concept of \"living in pure lands whenever you want\" suggests a deep sense of inner peace and tranquility. This is a wonderful state to be in. It's great that you feel overjoyed and have deepened your relationship with someone you trust. \n\nRemember to take care of yourself and nurture this positive state.

However, I can suggest a few general places where you might find Tibetan Buddhist texts, both in Tibetan and in translation:\n\n1. **Local Bookstores or Libraries**: Many larger bookstores and libraries have sections dedicated to religion and spirituality, which may include books on Tibetan Buddhism. You can also check with local university libraries, which often have extensive religious studies collections.\n\n2. **Online Retailers**: Websites like Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and other online bookstores often carry a wide variety of religious texts, including those related to Tibetan Buddhism. You can search for \"Tibetan Buddhist texts\" or \"Tibetan Buddhism books\" to find relevant results.\n\n3. **Specialty Stores**: There are online stores that specialize in religious texts and spiritual literature, such as Wisdom Books (wisdom-books.com) or the Asian Classics Press (acpress.org). These types of stores often carry a variety of texts in Tibetan and in translation.\n\n4. **Dharma Centers and Temples**: If there are Tibetan Buddhist communities or centers in your area, they may have resources available or be able to direct you to where you can find what you're looking for. These centers often have libraries or bookstores with texts in both Tibetan and translation.\n\n5. **Online Resources**: Websites like Amazon, Google Books, or Project MUSE (if you have access through a university or library) may have e-books or scanned versions of texts. Websites dedicated to Buddhism, like the 84000: Translating the Words of the Buddha (84000.co) or the Rigpa online shop (rigpawiki.org), may also be useful.\n\n6. **Digital Libraries and Archives**: Some universities and digital libraries provide access to religious texts, including those related to Tibetan Buddhism.

The answer is: \n\nThe cat broke its own bowl trying to catch the mouse.\n\nThe riddle relies on the use of wordplay and misdirection. \"The cat ate the mouse's tail\" is a literal statement about the cat eating the mouse's tail. However, the second part of the riddle (\"the cat's bowl is broken\") seems to imply a cause and effect relationship that isn't necessarily related. However, if you interpret \"the cat's bowl is broken\" as an event caused by the cat (such as the cat accidentally breaking the bowl while trying to catch the mouse), then it makes sense. \n\nBut, more commonly, this riddle is solved by realizing that the cat's bowl being broken has nothing to do with the mouse or its tail. The cat's bowl is broken because the cat is the one who broke it, probably in its attempt to catch the mouse, which is why it ate the mouse's tail.", "elapsed": 13.7, "model": "swiss-ai_Apertus-70B-Instruct-2509", "score": 2, "score_explanation": "2 — Completely misses the actual question and provides an elaborate analysis of a non-existent riddle.

{"question": "My question does not relate directly to the Diamond Way, but it concerns karma.How can the mind choose parents and conditions such that it then suffers from severe depression for the rest of its life when it knows its previous lives and knows that he died relatively young and yet violently, without hurting someone so badly. What is the point of his suffering in life?", "response": "The question of why an individual might choose to suffer from severe depression in their current life, despite knowing about their previous lives and understanding the cause of their suffering, touches on a complex topic that involves the concepts of karma and free will in the context of various spiritual traditions.\n\nIn Buddhism, particularly in the context of the Diamond Way, it's important to note that karma is not a fixed or predetermined fate but rather a dynamic and fluid process. The concept of karma refers to the law of cause and effect, where actions in one's current or past lives lead to consequences in the present or future. However, this doesn't mean that every experience of suffering is directly caused by a single action in a previous life. Instead, it's more about the accumulation of tendencies and habits (or \"seeds\") that we sow through our actions, speech, and thoughts, which can then ripen into experiences of suffering or happiness.\n\nRegarding the choice of parents and conditions for one's birth, the idea of \"choosing\" might be misleading. Instead, the process might be more accurately described as a manifestation of the mind's karmic tendencies. These tendencies are the result of past actions, which influence the circumstances of one's rebirth. However, the act of \"choosing\" implies a level of control or decision-making that might not be applicable in the context of Buddhist teachings on karma and rebirth.\n\nAs for why one might suffer from severe depression despite knowing their previous lives and the causes of their suffering, there are a few points to consider:\n\n1. **Understanding and Acceptance:** Knowing the causes of one's suffering can sometimes help in understanding and accepting it, but it doesn't always alleviate the suffering itself. The experience of severe depression can be deeply rooted in physiological, psychological, and environmental factors, which might not be directly influenced by the understanding of past lives or karma.\n\n2. **Karmic Tendencies and Habits:** The suffering from severe depression can be seen as the result of karmic tendencies that have not been fully transformed or purified. Even with knowledge of past lives, the habits and tendencies that contribute to depression might still be present and active. The point of this suffering could be seen as an opportunity for the individual to work through and transform these tendencies, which can be a part of their spiritual journey.\n\n3. **Spiritual Growth and Transformation:** In many spiritual traditions, including the Diamond Way, suffering is not seen as merely negative but as an opportunity for growth, transformation, and ultimately, liberation.

{"question": "How should someone work with an emotionally intense situation like rape? A friend recently asked how Buddhists view this and if there's a method to help the victim. I thought from Mahayana perspective, one could develop compassion for the rapist and deeply wish him caught and healed, since he's planting deep patterns in his mind. If the victim could experience this, it might help. Is there a better method? Or advice? Thanks.", "response": "I'm sorry to hear about the situation your friend is going through. It's important to approach this sensitive topic with care and respect, as it involves both the well-being of the victim and the perpetrator.\n\nBuddhist perspective on dealing with intense situations like rape:\n\n1. Compassion and Empathy: In Mahayana Buddhism, compassion is a central tenet. Practitioners are encouraged to develop compassion for all beings, including the perpetrator, understanding that the actions are likely a result of suffering and ignorance (avidya). However, this does not mean condoning or justifying the actions; rather, it is about understanding that the perpetrator is also a being in need of healing and understanding.\n\n2. Karma and Action: Buddhism does not condone or justify harmful actions, but it does recognize that actions (karma) have consequences. The concept of karma is often misunderstood; it's not about retribution but about the natural result of actions. The perpetrator will face consequences due to their actions, but these should be addressed through legal and social means, not through personal revenge or wish for harm.\n\n3. Healing and Support: The most important thing is to support the victim and help them through the healing process. This can involve professional help such as therapy, support groups, and legal assistance. The victim's well-being and safety should be the primary concern.\n\n4. Mindfulness and Mind Training: Buddhist practices like mindfulness and loving-kindness meditation can be beneficial for the victim to manage their emotional and psychological well-being. These practices can help in reducing stress, anxiety, and trauma symptoms. For the perpetrator, if they are seeking help, these practices can potentially help them understand their actions and develop more compassion and empathy for their victims.\n\n5. Legal and Social Justice: While Buddhism encourages compassion and understanding, it also recognizes the importance of justice and societal laws. The perpetrator should face the legal consequences of their actions. This serves as a deterrent and helps maintain social order.\n\n6. Support Networks: Encourage your friend to seek help from professional networks like rape crisis centers, therapists, and support groups. These resources are designed to provide the best possible support and guidance for victims of sexual violence.\n\n7. Personal Boundaries: It's important for the victim to set personal boundaries and not feel pressured into feeling or acting a certain way.

{"question": "What can happen on a long-term Diamond Way practitioner's path that they start lying and cheating?", "response": "As an AI, I can provide a general perspective on this matter, but please note that individual experiences may vary and can be influenced by a wide range of factors, including personal circumstances, psychological health, and the specific practices and teachings of the Diamond Way or any other spiritual path they might follow.\n\n1. **Misinterpretation or Misapplication of Teachings**: One possible reason for a long-term practitioner to start lying or cheating could be a misunderstanding or misapplication of their spiritual teachings. This might happen if the practitioner focuses too much on intellectual understanding, without integrating the teachings into their daily life and personal conduct.\n\n2. **Self-Justification**: Over time, practitioners might begin to justify their own wrongdoing or weaknesses by rationalizing that their spiritual path or status excuses or somehow negates their responsibility to uphold ethical standards. This could be due to an inflated sense of self-importance or a belief that their spiritual status somehow exempts them from ethical norms.\n\n3. **Psychological or Emotional Issues**: Spiritual practices, though beneficial, do not automatically heal or prevent psychological or emotional issues. A long-term practitioner might struggle with existing or emerging personal challenges like depression, anxiety, or other mental health issues, which could lead to behaviors like lying or cheating as coping mechanisms or due to distorted perceptions.\n\n4. **Expectations and Pressure**: The pressures to maintain a certain image or status within a spiritual community can sometimes lead to dishonest behavior. If a practitioner feels they need to present themselves as more advanced or enlightened than they are, they might resort to lying or cheating to maintain that image.\n\n5. **Lack of Accountability and Support**: Without a strong community or mentor providing regular, honest feedback and accountability, practitioners might not recognize or correct their own ethical lapses. This can happen if the community emphasizes individualism over community support, or if mentors are not available or effective in their roles.\n\n6. **The Allure of Power or Influence**: In some cases, the position of a long-term practitioner in a spiritual community might offer opportunities for influence or power. The corrupting influence of power could lead some individuals to abuse their position or status, engaging in dishonest or manipulative behavior.\n\n7. **External Pressures and Life Circumstances**: External factors such as stress from work, family, or financial pressures can sometimes cause people to act out of character or engage in behaviors they would otherwise avoid.
