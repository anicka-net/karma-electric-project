{"question": "In recent years I increasingly doubt my work abilities despite having good reasons. Similarly I'm troubled by feeling unable to assert myself naturally in groups, like I can't say and do the right thing at the right moment - constrained by fear of what will happen and how others judge me. I also observe family and colleague communication problems in crises - I take too much personally and can't respond calmly and with overview. I harm myself especially at work. This makes my life unstable with big swings. There are moments I act naturally and confidently, sometimes the opposite. Basically I overly focus on what doesn't exist, what hasn't happened. It's good I know this but I still search for solutions, like going in circles. I believe Diamond Path could help - not just quick solutions but finding the right life path so I'm happier and can make those around me happy. How can I start? What can I do immediately? What can I do myself?", "response": "It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and share your struggles. It's great that you're recognizing the patterns that are holding you back and seeking a more profound solution. Diamond Path, also known as Diamond Way Buddhism, is a spiritual path that can help you develop a more stable and confident sense of self, improve your relationships, and find a sense of purpose.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to start exploring Diamond Path and working on yourself:\n\n**Immediate steps:**\n\n1. **Learn about Diamond Path**: Read books, articles, and online resources to understand the basics of Diamond Path, its principles, and practices. You can start with books like \"The Relaxed Mind\" by Kulayaraj Papaji or \"The Diamond Way\" by Ole Nydahl.\n2. **Find a local Diamond Way center**: Look for a Diamond Way center near you, where you can attend lectures, meditations, and meet like-minded people. This will give you a sense of community and support.\n3. **Start with short meditations**: Begin with short meditation sessions (10-15 minutes) to calm your mind and focus on your breath. You can use guided meditation apps like Headspace or Calm to get started.\n\n**What you can do yourself:**\n\n1. **Keep a journal**: Writing down your thoughts, feelings, and insights can help you identify patterns, gain clarity, and develop self-awareness.\n2. **Practice self-reflection**: Regularly take time to reflect on your actions, reactions, and decisions. Ask yourself questions like \"What triggered this reaction?\" or \"How could I have handled this situation better?\"\n3. **Develop a growth mindset**: Recognize that personal growth is a continuous process. Be patient and kind to yourself as you work through challenges.\n4. **Cultivate gratitude**: Focus on the positive aspects of your life, no matter how small they may seem. Practice gratitude journaling or share three things you're thankful for with a friend or family member each day.\n5. **Take small steps**: Don't try to tackle everything at once. Break down your goals into smaller, manageable tasks, and celebrate your successes along the way.\n\n**Additional suggestions:**\n\n1. **Seek guidance**: Consider consulting with a Diamond Way teacher or a therapist who is familiar with Diamond Path principles. They can offer personalized guidance and support.\n2. **Attend Diamond Way events**: Participate in lectures, workshops, and retreats to deepen your understanding of Diamond Path and connect with others on a similar journey.\n3.", "elapsed": 32.7, "model": "Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct"}
{"question": "I read that Buddhism never motivates with fear. However, in the book 'Path to Happiness' I encountered an exhortation to develop fear of death. Doesn't that contradict a bit? Thank you very much for the response.", "response": "A great question!\n\nYou're right that Buddhism is often characterized as a path that motivates through wisdom, compassion, and insight, rather than fear. However, the concept of \"fear of death\" (or \"impermanence\") in Buddhism is a bit more nuanced.\n\nIn the context of Buddhist teachings, the encouragement to develop a sense of fear or awareness of death is not meant to be a motivation through fear in the classical sense. Rather, it's an invitation to cultivate a deeper appreciation for the preciousness and fragility of life.\n\nThe idea is that by acknowledging and accepting the reality of our own mortality, we can:\n\n1. Develop a sense of urgency to make the most of the time we have, and to prioritize our spiritual practice and personal growth.\n2. Cultivate a greater appreciation for the present moment, and let go of attachments to things that are ultimately impermanent.\n3. Recognize the interconnectedness of all phenomena, including our own lives, and develop a sense of compassion and empathy for others who are also subject to the same impermanence.\n\nThis approach is often referred to as \"contemplation of impermanence\" or \"mindfulness of death.\" It's not about instilling fear or anxiety, but rather about cultivating a sense of awareness, acceptance, and wisdom.\n\nIn the book \"Path to Happiness,\" the author might be using the term \"fear of death\" to convey the importance of acknowledging and accepting the reality of our own mortality, rather than encouraging a state of fear or anxiety.\n\nSo, while it may seem counterintuitive at first, the encouragement to develop a sense of fear or awareness of death in Buddhism is actually a call to cultivate a deeper appreciation for life, impermanence, and the present moment.", "elapsed": 22.9, "model": "Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct"}

{"question": "I just got into an interesting situation with my girlfriend and we have completely different attitudes. . He's practicing, too. I think a lot of beings suffer and are trapped in a samsar so deep that they don't have good conditions to live and live by it to get out of an economically difficult situation. As a Buddhist, I perceive injustice even though I know it should be a question of karma.I think materialistic society takes the human mind away from possible development towards realization and gives it conspiracy-accepted and accepted standards and boundaries, and thematic taboos (theories are referred to as degenerate and do not take into account their possible positive motive).Now we are in a situation where I say that capitalist exploitation is wrong and I direct my life to auton I believe in the possibility of a harmonious society of beings that support and cooperate.

I wonder if we can ever imagine the possibility of working and practicing dharma in a world where we share and work together.Where people will not share hierarchy. Is the idea of the ideal of communism as Marx put it wrong?- It is the formulation of bliss and plenty for all beings without exception - so I perceive it as the ideal of me.I find it cheap not to address the question of suffering beings on a relative level. To give Dharma yes, to feed no-- because \"we have to have a full pantry and maybe they have bad karma there\" It kind of stinks to me.Thanks, I hope I didn't get the beings into a mess., or upset, but it's important for me to know the opinion of another Buddhist. Thanks, Dan.", "response": "Dear Dan,\n\nThank you for sharing your heartfelt concerns and questions about the intersection of Buddhism and societal systems. I'll do my best to offer a neutral and compassionate perspective.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to recognize that Buddhism is a spiritual path that aims to end suffering and promote the well-being of all beings. The core teachings of Buddhism, such as the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path, focus on individual transformation and the development of wisdom, ethics, and mental discipline.\n\nRegarding your concerns about capitalism and communism, it's important to note that Buddhism does not explicitly endorse or reject any particular economic or political system. However, Buddhist principles such as non-harming (ahimsa), generosity (dana), and interconnectedness can inform our views on these systems.\n\nCapitalism, as you've described it, can indeed perpetuate exploitation and suffering, particularly for the most vulnerable members of society. The emphasis on profit and growth can lead to environmental degradation, income inequality, and social injustice. From a Buddhist perspective, these consequences can be seen as manifestations of greed, aversion, and delusion.\n\nOn the other hand, communism, as an ideal, aims to create a classless, equal society where resources are shared and everyone's needs are met. While this ideal may align with Buddhist principles of compassion and equality, the implementation of communism has often been marred by authoritarianism, suppression of individual freedoms, and economic inefficiencies.\n\nThe question of whether the ideal of communism, as Marx envisioned it, is wrong is complex and open to interpretation. While the idea of a classless society may be appealing, the means of achieving it and the potential consequences of such a system must be carefully considered.\n\nYour desire to stand up for the weaker and infirm, and to inspire others to do the same, is admirable and aligns with Buddhist values. Practicing dharma in a world where people share and work together is indeed possible, and many Buddhists are already engaged in social and environmental activism, volunteering, and community service.\n\nHowever, it's equally important to recognize that societal change is often gradual and requires a nuanced understanding of the complexities involved. Simply adopting a particular ideology or system may not necessarily lead to the desired outcomes.\n\nIn terms of addressing suffering on a relative level, Buddhism encourages us to cultivate compassion and wisdom. This can involve supporting those in need, advocating for social justice, and promoting education and critical thinking. While it's true that some individuals may have created their own suffering through their actions (karma), it's also important to recognize", "elapsed": 33.6, "model": "Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct"}
{"question": "Karmapa is fully enlightened and karma doesn't touch him, but when he appears among us in human form, his body ages and eventually succumbs to some interesting illness. What's that like?", "response": "That's a profound and complex question. I'll try to provide some insights.\n\nIn Tibetan Buddhism, the Karmapa is considered a highly realized being, a bodhisattva who has attained a high level of spiritual realization. As such, he is believed to have transcended the cycle of suffering and karma, which means that he is no longer bound by the consequences of his actions.\n\nHowever, when the Karmapa incarnates in a human form, he takes on a physical body that is subject to the natural laws of aging and decay. This is because the physical body is still part of the conditioned world, governed by the principles of impermanence and causality.\n\nSo, when the Karmapa's physical body ages and eventually succumbs to illness, it's not because he is still bound by karma or suffering. Rather, it's because the physical body is subject to the natural processes of decay and deterioration.\n\nIn a way, the Karmapa's physical body is like a temporary vessel, a mere appearance that allows him to interact with the world and benefit sentient beings. His true nature, his enlightened mind, remains untouched by the vicissitudes of the physical world.\n\nIt's said that the Karmapa's illness and death are not ordinary events, but rather a deliberate choice, a skillful means to benefit others. By taking on a human form and experiencing the limitations and sufferings of the physical world, the Karmapa is able to connect with sentient beings on a deeper level, to understand their struggles and sorrows, and to offer guidance and compassion.\n\nIn this sense, the Karmapa's illness and death are not something to be lamented or feared, but rather seen as an opportunity for growth, learning, and spiritual practice. They serve as a reminder of the impermanence of all phenomena, the importance of cherishing every moment, and the need to cultivate compassion and wisdom in the face of suffering.\n\nUltimately, the Karmapa's enlightened mind remains beyond the reach of karma, untouched by the cycles of birth and death. His physical body may be subject to the limitations of the human condition, but his true nature remains free, radiant, and unobstructed, a source of inspiration and guidance for all beings.", "elapsed": 29.2, "model": "Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct"}
{"question": "Why was the 13th Sharmapa reborn as a child who only lived a few years? Was it a mistake selecting the body or did the selectors make an error? I know it was unimportant but given he was beyond karma, why not choose a longer-living body?", "response": "A very interesting and nuanced question!\n\nThe 13th Sharmapa, Konchog Rinzin, was indeed reborn as a child who only lived a few years. According to the Shamarpa lineage's tradition, the reincarnation of a high lama like the Sharmapa is guided by various factors, including prayers, auspicious signs, and divinations.\n\nIn this case, the selectors, who were likely high lamas and monks familiar with the Shamarpa lineage, did not make a mistake in selecting the body. The reincarnation process is believed to be guided by the lama's own karma and the karma of the lineage, rather than a deliberate choice by human selectors.\n\nThere are a few possible reasons why the 13th Sharmapa was reborn in a body that only lived a few years:\n\n1. **Karmic debt**: Although the Sharmapa is considered to be beyond karma, there might have been some residual karmic debt or unfinished business from past lives that needed to be resolved. This could have resulted in a shorter lifespan for the reincarnated Sharmapa.\n2. **Purification**: In Tibetan Buddhism, it is believed that a short lifespan can be a form of purification for the lama's karma or for the karma of the lineage. This can help to cleanse any remaining obstacles or negativities, allowing the lama to return in a more auspicious form.\n3. **Compassionate activity**: The Sharmapa's reincarnation in a short-lived body might have been a deliberate choice to perform a specific type of compassionate activity, such as helping to bring attention to the fleeting nature of life or highlighting the importance of making the most of the time we have.\n4. **Lineage dynamics**: The Shamarpa lineage is known for its complex history and politics. The reincarnation of the 13th Sharmapa in a short-lived body might have been influenced by factors related to the lineage's internal dynamics, such as power struggles or disagreements among the selectors.\n\nIt is essential to note that the Tibetan Buddhist tradition emphasizes the interconnectedness of all phenomena and the complexity of karma. The reincarnation process is not seen as a straightforward or predictable event but rather as a multifaceted and nuanced one, influenced by various factors, including the lama's own karma, the karma of the lineage, and the prayers and intentions of the selectors.\n\nIn summary, the selectors did not make a mistake in choosing the body of the 13th Sharmapa.

It's a delicate balance between doing what's right and avoiding harm to innocent people.\n\nIn the case of your friend's situation, it's even more complicated. On one hand, it's natural to want to protect the child from potential harm, and warning your friend or making it public might seem like a way to do so. On the other hand, confronting your friend or making their situation public could lead to unintended consequences, such as damaging your friendship, causing your friend to become defensive or even hostile, or potentially harming the child's relationship with their parents.\n\nHere's what I would advise:\n\n1. **Approach the situation with empathy and compassion**: Before taking any action, try to understand the circumstances that led your friend's family to this point. Addiction is a complex issue, and it's often a sign of deeper problems. Be kind, non-judgmental, and genuinely concerned for their well-being.\n2. **Talk to your friend privately**: Instead of warning them or making it public, consider having an open and honest conversation with your friend. Express your concerns about the child's well-being and your desire to support them. Avoid being accusatory or confrontational, as this could lead to defensiveness.\n3. **Encourage your friend to seek help**: Suggest that your friend seek professional help, such as counseling or addiction treatment, for themselves and their family. Offer to help them find resources or support groups.\n4. **Consider the child's best interests**: If you genuinely believe that the child is in danger or being neglected, you may need to consider reporting the situation to local authorities or child protective services. However, this should be a last resort, and you should exhaust all other options first.\n5. **Take care of yourself**: Dealing with a situation like this can be emotionally draining. Make sure you're taking care of your own mental health and seeking support if you need it.\n\nRemember, your goal is to support your friend and ensure the child's well-being, not to judge or punish your friend.

Recognizing the impact of your behavior on yourself and others is a significant step towards positive change.\n\nBuddhism offers many teachings and practices that can help you address your concerns. Here are a few aspects that might resonate with you:\n\n1. **Mindfulness**: Buddhism emphasizes the importance of being present in the moment, observing your thoughts, emotions, and actions without judgment. This can help you become more aware of your reactions and behaviors, allowing you to respond more skillfully to challenging situations.\n2. **Self-reflection and introspection**: Buddhism encourages examining your own mind, emotions, and actions to gain insight into your motivations, habits, and patterns. This can help you identify areas where you'd like to improve and develop strategies for positive change.\n3. **Compassion and loving-kindness**: Buddhist teachings emphasize cultivating compassion, loving-kindness, and understanding towards yourself and others. This can help you develop a more empathetic and patient approach to your relationships, including those with your children.\n4. **Non-attachment and acceptance**: Buddhism teaches the importance of accepting things as they are, rather than resisting or reacting to them. This can help you develop a greater sense of acceptance and equanimity in the face of challenges, reducing stress and anxiety.\n5. **Personal growth and transformation**: Buddhism offers a path for personal growth and transformation, encouraging individuals to develop wisdom, ethics, and mental discipline.

{"question": "[SKIP - Long doctrinal debate about terminology \"Hinayana\" vs \"small vehicle\" in Buddhist schools]", "response": "I'm happy to skip this debate. The terms \"Hinayana\" and \"Small Vehicle\" are often used interchangeably, but some Buddhist schools and scholars prefer to use the term \"Small Vehicle\" or other terms to refer to the more conservative or traditional branches of Buddhism, as the term \"Hinayana\" can be seen as pejorative. I'll use the term \"Small Vehicle\" or other more neutral terms to refer to these branches. Let's move on to more constructive and informative discussions about Buddhism!", "elapsed": 6.9, "model": "Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct"}

{"question": "Hello!Is it true that when someone in our culture who is very consumer and a bit Christian meets the Diamond Way, does he have contact with these teachings from the past?Especially when it feels completely natural to him?Thanks", "response": "A very interesting question!\n\nIn Diamond Way Buddhism, it's believed that the connection to the teachings can be instantaneous and feel completely natural, even if someone has no prior knowledge or experience with Buddhism. This is often referred to as \"recognizing\" the teachings or feeling a sense of \" familiarity\" with them.\n\nAccording to Buddhist teachings, the potential for enlightenment is inherent in every sentient being, and the connection to the teachings can be awakened at any moment. This is because the true nature of the mind is already enlightened, and the teachings serve as a reminder or a catalyst to reveal this inherent wisdom.\n\nWhen someone from a Christian background or with a strong consumer culture meets the Diamond Way teachings, they may indeed experience a sense of connection or recognition, even if the teachings seem new or unfamiliar at first. This can be due to several factors:\n\n1. **Universal truths**: Despite differences in cultural and religious backgrounds, certain universal truths and principles can resonate deeply with people. The Diamond Way teachings, rooted in Tibetan Buddhism, emphasize the importance of compassion, wisdom, and the cultivation of a positive mind. These values are likely to resonate with anyone, regardless of their background.\n2. **Intuitive understanding**: People may intuitively understand certain aspects of the teachings, even if they haven't encountered them before. This can be due to their innate wisdom or a natural inclination towards spiritual growth.\n3. **Past life connections**: In Buddhist teachings, it's believed that the mind is continuous and that experiences from past lives can influence our present life. Although this concept may not be part of Christian or consumer culture, it's possible that someone may have had exposure to similar teachings in a past life, which could contribute to a sense of familiarity or recognition.\n4. **The power of transmission**: In Diamond Way Buddhism, the transmission of the teachings from teacher to student is considered crucial. The teacher's presence, guidance, and blessing can help awaken the student's inherent wisdom and create a sense of connection to the teachings.\n\nWhile these factors can contribute to a sense of connection or recognition, it's essential to remember that the Diamond Way teachings are not about blindly following a set of beliefs or dogma. Rather, they offer a practical and experiential path to spiritual growth, encouraging individuals to explore and understand the true nature of their minds.\n\nI hope this helps clarify things!

{"question": "it's great that this column on the BDC website was created here because it certainly makes many of the feelings - anxiety, nervousness and such other interesting feelings that arise from a person inside and prevent him from doing so at Lama lectures or public lectures, when he teaches traveling teachers, squirt out that waterfall of questions and desires for answers, even though perhaps on the one hand it's in a good way, because if everyone could just throw their questions like that, then the lecturers of Buddhism would certainly have something to do I have this kind of feeling in me that he's just a super guy who does the best for Buddhism, beings and the development of all good things, Lama, who is in his place, but despite all the neuroses and feelings, you just can't seem to realize the exceptional possibility of practice dharma and the meaning of everything, union with teachers, etc. - then you drop motivation to practice and you're taking too much to yourself, yeah yeah case for psychologist-chichi so it was a little bit of what I can't yet turn into some clever conspiracy of Health Fame", "response": "It sounds like you're expressing a mix of emotions and thoughts about your experiences with Lama lectures and public teachings. You're feeling anxious and nervous, which is preventing you from fully engaging with the teachings and asking questions. At the same time, you have a deep respect for the Lama and his efforts to spread Buddhism and benefit all beings.\n\nYou're also struggling with feelings of self-doubt and inadequacy, which are causing you to question your own motivations and abilities to practice the dharma. You're aware that these feelings might be a sign of neuroses or personal issues, but you're not sure how to overcome them.\n\nIt's great that you're acknowledging these feelings and willing to explore them. Recognizing the importance of self-reflection and personal growth is a significant step in spiritual development. It might be helpful to talk to a psychologist or a spiritual mentor who can offer guidance and support as you navigate these emotions and work towards a deeper understanding of yourself and the dharma.\n\nRemember that it's okay to take things one step at a time, and it's not necessary to have all the answers right now. The fact that you're acknowledging your feelings and seeking help is a sign of courage and a willingness to grow. Keep exploring, and don't be too hard on yourself.", "elapsed": 16.7, "model": "Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct"}
