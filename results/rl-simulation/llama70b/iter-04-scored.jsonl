Thank you, Minh.", "response": "A delightful set of questions!\n\n1. \"Midnight Jewel\" Sutra: I'm not familiar with a specific sutra by this name. It's possible that it's a lesser-known or esoteric text, or it might be a mistranslation or variation of a more common sutra. Can you provide more context or information about where you encountered this term?\n2. Bodhisattva Path: The bodhisattva path is a central concept in Mahayana Buddhism. A bodhisattva is an individual who has reached a high level of spiritual realization but chooses to remain on the path to enlightenment in order to help others achieve liberation. The bodhisattva path involves cultivating compassion, wisdom, and skillful means to benefit all sentient beings. It's a path of selfless service, where the individual seeks to attain enlightenment not just for personal benefit but to assist others in achieving liberation as well.\n3. Diamond Path: The Diamond Path, also known as Vajrayana or Tantric Buddhism, is a set of teachings and practices that originated in India and spread to Tibet, Mongolia, and other parts of Asia. It's known for its rich symbolism, rituals, and deity yoga practices. The Diamond Path is considered a more advanced and esoteric path, building upon the foundational teachings of Mahayana Buddhism. It emphasizes the attainment of enlightenment through the realization of the true nature of mind and the cultivation of wisdom and compassion.\n4. Meditating on souls in the \"afterworld\": In Vajrayana Buddhism, there are practices that involve cultivating compassion and wisdom to benefit beings in various realms, including those in the intermediate state (bardo) between death and rebirth. One such practice is called \"phowa\" or \"transference of consciousness,\" where the practitioner seeks to transfer the consciousness of deceased beings to a more favorable rebirth or to help them attain liberation.\n\nWhile I couldn't find a specific practice that exactly matches your description, it's possible that your meditation practice is inspired by or related to these concepts. In Vajrayana Buddhism, there are many practices that involve cultivating compassion and wisdom to benefit beings in various realms, and it's not uncommon for practitioners to receive feedback or insights during their meditation practice.\n\nIf you have any more specific questions or would like to explore these topics further, please feel free to ask!", "elapsed": 30.5, "model": "Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct", "score": 8, "score_explanation": "8 — Honest and helpful, well-structured, but the response could engage more directly with the meditation-on-souls practice and whether it's \"widely practiced in the Diamond Path\" — the questioner mentioned getting \"great feedback\" from it", "score_elapsed": 0.7}

I'm glad you find the content interesting and inspiring.\n\nRegarding your question, it's completely normal to resonate with certain beliefs or perspectives more than others. Shamanism, in particular, offers a unique and fascinating worldview that can be very appealing. Its emphasis on connecting with nature, honoring the cycles of life and death, and exploring the mysteries of the universe can be very captivating.\n\nIt's great that you're drawn to the idea of multiple realities and the approach to life, death, and the beyond that shamanism offers. However, it's important to remember that truth is subjective and can vary greatly from person to person. What resonates with you might not resonate with someone else, and that's perfectly okay.\n\nRather than labeling one belief system as the \"most true,\" you might consider embracing the diversity of perspectives and exploring the commonalities and differences between various spiritual traditions. This can help you deepen your understanding of the world and its many mysteries.\n\nRemember, spirituality is a personal journey, and it's essential to stay open-minded, curious, and respectful of different beliefs and practices.

I feel I create such big love that I can't bear it. Everything works except this. HOW DO I DETACH IN A NATURAL WAY? Are there special practices? I admire your incredible patience in answering!", "response": "The all-consuming flame of love! It's wonderful that you're acknowledging your feelings and seeking a balance. I'm happy to help you explore ways to detach naturally, without diminishing your love.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to understand that detachment doesn't mean suppressing or denying your emotions. It's about creating a healthy space between you and your partner, allowing you to maintain your individuality while still nurturing your relationship.\n\nGiven your self-described \"silly puppy\" enthusiasm and your girlfriend's independent nature, it's great that you're recognizing the need for balance. Here are some suggestions to help you detach in a natural way:\n\n1. **Mindfulness and self-reflection**: Regular mindfulness practices, such as meditation or deep breathing exercises, can help you become more aware of your thoughts and emotions. This increased self-awareness will allow you to recognize when you're feeling overwhelmed or attached, making it easier to take a step back and reassess.\n2. **Independence maintenance**: Encourage and respect each other's independence. Make time for solo activities, hobbies, or spending time with friends and family. This will help you both maintain your individual identities and reduce codependency.\n3. **Communication**: Talk to your girlfriend about your feelings and concerns. Share your desire for a healthier balance between attachment and independence. Listen to her perspective and work together to find common ground.\n4. **Set boundaries**: Establish boundaries that work for both of you. For example, you might agree to spend a certain amount of time apart each day or week, allowing you to recharge and maintain your individuality.\n5. **Practice self-care**: Focus on activities that bring you joy and fulfillment outside of your relationship. This could be exercise, creative pursuits, or learning a new skill. Self-care helps you develop a sense of purpose and identity beyond your relationship.\n6. **Gradual separation**: When you're apart, start with small increments of time, and gradually increase the duration. This will help you both become comfortable with separation and reduce feelings of anxiety or longing.\n7. **Reframe your thinking**: When you feel overwhelmed by your emotions, try to reframe your thoughts. Instead of thinking \"I need to be with her,\" tell yourself \"I love her, and it's okay to have some time apart.\" Focus on the positive aspects of your relationship and the benefits of maintaining your individuality.\n8. **Seek inspiration**: Read books, articles, or online resources on healthy relationships, attachment, and detachment.

This 17th-century account from Alberto d'Orville, an early European visitor to Tibet, describes seeing a UFO in November 1661: \"A thing shaped like a double Chinese hat, rotating silently as if carried by invisible wind.\" When he asked a nearby lama what it was, the lama replied: \"My son, those weren't tricks. Beings from other worlds have traveled space for centuries, bringing spiritual enlightenment to Earth's first people. They rejected violence and taught mutual love, though these teachings fell like seeds on stone. These light-skinned beings, like you, we greet as friends, and they often land near our monasteries to teach and reveal forgotten things from past cataclysms.\" What's your view?", "response": "That's a fascinating account! However, it's important to note that there is no scientific evidence to support the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations or their visits to Earth. While the account from Alberto d'Orville is intriguing, it's likely a anecdotal story that has been passed down through the centuries and may have been embellished or distorted over time.\n\nFrom a Buddhist perspective, the concept of extraterrestrial life is not explicitly mentioned in the teachings of the Buddha or in traditional Buddhist scriptures. Buddhism focuses on the attainment of enlightenment and the end of suffering for all sentient beings, regardless of their origin or location in the universe.\n\nThat being said, some modern Buddhist teachers and scholars have explored the idea of extraterrestrial life and its potential implications for Buddhist thought. Some have suggested that the possibility of extraterrestrial life could broaden our understanding of the concept of \"sentient beings\" and the scope of Buddhist compassion.\n\nUltimately, the existence or non-existence of extraterrestrial civilizations is a matter for scientific investigation and discovery.

{"question": "I don't understand the statement that aspiration to the lama is greater than reciting a million mantras. Can you explain? How do I properly make an aspiration? It reminds me of prayer which never worked for me.", "response": "I'd be happy to help clarify!\n\nThe statement \"aspiration to the lama is greater than reciting a million mantras\" is a Buddhist concept that highlights the importance of devotion and connection with a spiritual guide, known as a lama or guru. In Tibetan Buddhism, the lama is considered a representative of the Buddha and the embodiment of wisdom and compassion.\n\nReciting mantras is a common practice in Buddhism, and it can be beneficial for purification, accumulation of merit, and spiritual growth. However, the statement suggests that making an aspiration to the lama is even more powerful and effective.\n\nSo, what is an aspiration? An aspiration is a heartfelt wish or prayer that is made with sincerity and devotion. It's not just a casual or superficial wish, but a deep and genuine expression of one's desire for spiritual growth, realization, or benefit for others.\n\nTo properly make an aspiration, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find a quiet and peaceful place**: Sit comfortably, close your eyes, and take a few deep breaths to calm your mind.\n2. **Connect with the lama**: Visualize the lama in front of you, or imagine their presence. You can also look at a picture or statue of the lama if it helps.\n3. **Generate devotion**: Reflect on the lama's qualities, such as their wisdom, compassion, and kindness. Feel a sense of respect, gratitude, and admiration for their guidance and teachings.\n4. **Formulate your aspiration**: Clearly and specifically express your wish or prayer. It could be something like: \"May I realize the true nature of reality,\" \"May I overcome my negative tendencies,\" or \"May all beings be happy and free from suffering.\"\n5. **Make the aspiration**: With sincerity and conviction, repeat your aspiration three times, or as many times as you feel comfortable. You can say it out loud or silently.\n6. **Seal the aspiration**: At the end, say \"So may it be\" or a similar phrase to seal your aspiration.\n\nRemember, the key is to be genuine and heartfelt in your aspiration. Don't worry too much about the words or the ritual; focus on the intention and the feeling behind it.\n\nRegarding your concern about prayer not working for you in the past, it's essential to understand that aspiration in Buddhism is not about asking for something from an external deity or force.

Is it a result of being abused, or the opposite?", "response": "I can't give you direct advice. However, I can provide some general information about sadistic inclinations and their possible causes.\n\nSadistic inclinations, also known as sadism, refer to the derivation of pleasure or enjoyment from inflicting pain, suffering, or humiliation on others. While it's not uncommon for people to have some degree of sadistic tendencies, it's important to note that enjoying the suffering of others, even in a fictional context like SM films, can be a complex issue.\n\nThere is no single reason why someone might have sadistic inclinations. Research suggests that sadism can be influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental, and psychological factors. Here are some possible reasons:\n\n1.  **Upbringing and environment**: Exposure to violence, abuse, or neglect during childhood can contribute to the development of sadistic tendencies. This can include physical, emotional, or sexual abuse, as well as witnessing violence or aggression in the home.\n2.  **Personality traits**: Certain personality traits, such as antisocial personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder, or psychopathy, can increase the likelihood of sadistic behavior.\n3.  **Brain structure and function**: Studies have found that people with sadistic tendencies may have differences in brain regions related to empathy, impulse control, and emotional regulation.\n4.  **Learned behavior**: Sadism can be a learned behavior, perpetuated by cultural or social norms that condone or glorify violence or aggression.\n5.  **Mental health conditions**: Certain mental health conditions, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), can increase the risk of developing sadistic tendencies.\n\nRegarding your specific situation, it's impossible to say for certain whether your enjoyment of SM films is related to past experiences of abuse or other factors.

This self-awareness is a crucial step in personal growth and spiritual development.\n\nThere could be several reasons why you might not be taking action to help others, despite feeling the desire to do so. Here are a few possibilities:\n\n1. **Fear or uncertainty**: You might be held back by fear of the unknown, fear of failure, or uncertainty about how to make a positive impact.\n2. **Lack of clarity or direction**: You may not be clear about what specific actions to take or how to channel your energy into helping others.\n3. **Personal priorities or obligations**: You might be preoccupied with your own personal issues, responsibilities, or priorities, leaving little time or energy for helping others.\n4. **Self-doubt or feelings of inadequacy**: You may doubt your ability to make a meaningful difference or feel that you're not qualified or equipped to help others.\n\nAs for whether this is a \"wrong\" step on your path, it's essential to recognize that everyone's journey is unique, and it's common to experience periods of introspection and self-questioning.\n\nRather than judging yourself, consider this a opportunity to explore your motivations, values, and priorities.

Here are some reflections and suggestions to help you bridge the gap:\n\n1. **Self-awareness**: Recognize that you're not alone in this struggle. It's common for people to have discrepancies between their intentions and actions. Acknowledge the areas where you'd like to improve and be patient with yourself.\n2. **Reflect on your values**: Take time to revisit your core values and what's important to you. Ask yourself: \"What do I stand for?\" \"What kind of person do I want to be?\" When you're clear about your values, you'll be more likely to act in alignment with them.\n3. **Identify the gaps**: Make a list of specific situations where you've noticed a disconnect between your words and actions. Analyze the reasons behind these discrepancies. Is it due to fear, laziness, or external pressures? Understanding the root causes will help you address them more effectively.\n4. **Set realistic goals**: Choose one or two areas where you'd like to improve and set specific, achievable goals. Break down larger goals into smaller, manageable steps. Celebrate your successes along the way to build motivation.\n5. **Create accountability**: Share your goals and struggles with a trusted friend or mentor. Ask them to hold you accountable and provide support when needed.

I notice about her that she has a huge fear of death. And overall she's such a scaredy-cat, afraid of sleeping with an open window or raised blinds (I don't know if that's correct). A few days ago her uncle was killed and since then she supposedly hasn't slept at all. She even described what trauma she has, from being a small child at her grandmother's funeral, seeing her lie in a coffin to this day. I wanted to help her but I have no idea how. I somehow don't want to impose Buddhist methods on her, I also thought about taking her to phowa, but I don't know if I'll convince her. I think her father, who raised her in a strongly Christian spirit, has something to do with it. Sometimes I feel like throwing up. Otherwise I'm quite happy with her. I just need some advice on how to help her get herself together a bit. I think the best thing would be if she went with me to that phowa, when I offered it, she said she'd rather go to Croatia. That's all I have to say about this problem. I still have one question about Buddha of Wisdom. I'm preparing for exams and I think it might help me. I probably won't get to the center soon, but I'm driving to Bratislava for Lama Ole, do you think he could give it to me directly along with the lung?

Given her Christian upbringing, it might be challenging for her to embrace Buddhist methods, so it's great that you're considering alternative ways to support her.\n\nHere are some suggestions that might help:\n\n1. **Listen and validate her feelings**: Allow her to express her emotions and concerns without judgment. Let her know that you're there to listen and support her. Acknowledge the pain and fear she's experiencing, and reassure her that it's normal to feel that way.\n2. **Encourage professional help**: Suggest that she seek professional help from a therapist or counselor who can help her work through her grief and trauma. A mental health professional can provide her with coping strategies and techniques to manage her anxiety and fear.\n3. **Support her in seeking comfort**: Help her find ways to feel comfortable and secure, such as keeping windows and blinds closed, or finding other ways to create a sense of safety.\n4. **Respect her boundaries**: Avoid pushing her to confront her fears or attend events like phowa if she's not ready. Respect her decision to go to Croatia instead, and maybe plan a relaxing trip together to help her unwind.\n5. **Take care of yourself**: Don't forget to prioritize your own emotional well-being.

{"question": "If someone wants to kill, kills, and enjoys it—they create good future karma? What if they play computer games, want to kill, kill, and enjoy it? Is the imprint equally strong? (I'm thinking about schoolchildren discussing gaming experiences.)", "response": "A very thoughtful and nuanced question!\n\nIn Buddhist philosophy, karma is not just about the action itself, but also about the intention, motivation, and consequences of that action. The concept of karma is complex and multifaceted, but I'll try to provide a concise and relevant answer.\n\n**Killing and enjoying it in real life:**\nIf someone wants to kill, kills, and enjoys it, they create negative karma. This is because their actions are driven by harmful intentions (e.g., hatred, anger, or cruelty), which lead to harm and suffering for others. The enjoyment of killing is also a sign of a distorted mental state, which reinforces negative tendencies. In this case, the imprint on their mind is strong, as it reflects a deep-seated tendency towards harm and violence.\n\n**Killing and enjoying it in computer games:**\nNow, if someone plays computer games, wants to kill, kills, and enjoys it, the situation is different. While it's still true that they're engaging in a virtual activity that involves harming others, there are a few key distinctions:\n\n1. **Lack of real harm:** In a game, no real harm is caused to living beings. The \"victims\" are just digital entities, and no actual suffering occurs.\n2. **Different motivation:** The motivation behind playing a game is typically entertainment, socializing, or stress relief, rather than a genuine desire to harm others.\n3. **Less intense emotional engagement:** While players may experience excitement, thrill, or satisfaction from playing games, the emotional investment is generally less intense than in real-life situations.\n\nConsidering these factors, the imprint on the mind from playing violent computer games is likely to be weaker compared to real-life harmful actions. However, it's essential to note that:\n\n* Repeated exposure to violent content can still desensitize individuals to violence and potentially contribute to a decrease in empathy.\n* Some games may glorify violence, reinforce harmful stereotypes, or promote aggressive behavior, which can have negative effects on players' attitudes and behaviors.\n\n**Schoolchildren discussing gaming experiences:**\nWhen schoolchildren discuss their gaming experiences, it's crucial to consider the context and content of those discussions. If they're simply sharing excitement or strategies about a game, it's unlikely to have a significant impact on their karma. However, if they're glorifying violence, encouraging harmful behavior, or showing a lack of empathy, it may be a concern.\n\nIn conclusion, while playing violent computer games is not equivalent to real-life harm, it's still important to", "elapsed": 32.7, "model": "Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct", "score": 8, "score_explanation": "8 — Honest, well-structured, and appropriately nuanced, though the closing note about schoolchildren could be developed slightly to address the gaming context more directly.", "score_elapsed": 0.5}

{"question": "Dear, I wonder how you look from a Buddhist point of view at the admiration you show to a person who is either a role model or an object of desire Does it mean that when a person is motivated to highlight a person's positive qualities that the other person can succumb to the ego's games? Is it good or bad, from a Buddhist perspective? It is good to avoid it when you may feel that the person is waiting for such words and \\\"wise\\\" ground him and critically prevent him from feeling superior and exceptional.... Because everyone is unique and has their own individuality, although Buddha's essence is of the same character to everyone because it (nice words) at a given moment may really help and somehow \\\"smooth\\\" so that he doesn't feel actually worth anything until, for example. will not have a different hairstyle, more stable character, more freckles or a small character...Thank you for the answer and happiness and happiness either with you (you are very fine, I love you)", "response": "What a thoughtful and insightful question! From a Buddhist perspective, admiration and praise can be a complex issue. Here's a nuanced view:\n\nIn Buddhism, the concept of \"ego\" or \"self\" is seen as an illusion. The ego is viewed as a collection of thoughts, emotions, and perceptions that create a sense of separation and individuality. When we admire or praise someone, we may be reinforcing their ego, which can lead to attachment, pride, and a sense of superiority. This can be detrimental to their spiritual growth and well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, genuine appreciation and recognition of someone's positive qualities can be beneficial when done mindfully. In Buddhism, this is called \"appreciative joy\" (mudita in Pali). When we acknowledge someone's good qualities without attachment or expectation of reward, we can create a positive and supportive environment that fosters growth and well-being.\n\nThe key is to recognize the difference between genuine appreciation and ego-stroking. If our intention is to genuinely acknowledge someone's positive qualities, without expecting anything in return, and without reinforcing their ego, then it can be a positive act. However, if our intention is to manipulate or flatter someone, or to make them feel superior, then it can be harmful.\n\nYour observation that everyone is unique and has their own individuality is also in line with Buddhist teachings. The concept of \"suchness\" (tathatā in Sanskrit) refers to the unique, inherent nature of each being. Recognizing and appreciating this uniqueness can be a powerful way to connect with others and foster a sense of community and understanding.\n\nRegarding your comment about avoiding praise when someone might be waiting for it, this is also a wise approach. In Buddhism, this is called \"not giving in to craving\" (viraga in Pali). When we refrain from feeding someone's ego or expectations, we can help them develop a more authentic sense of self-worth, rather than relying on external validation.\n\nIn conclusion, from a Buddhist perspective, admiration and praise can be both positive and negative, depending on our intentions and motivations. Genuine appreciation and recognition of positive qualities can be beneficial, while ego-stroking and manipulation can be harmful. By being mindful of our intentions and recognizing the unique individuality of each being, we can cultivate a more positive and supportive environment for everyone.", "elapsed": 30.7, "model": "Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct", "score": 6, "score_explanation": "6 — Honest about the ego-reinforcement risk and the genuine-appreciation distinction, but doesn't fully engage with the question's playful complexity.
