## Quality Characteristics of Generated Scenarios

All 101 scenarios follow the established format with:

- **Realistic first-person questions** grounded in real human struggles
- **Comprehensive context** including stakes, affected parties, time pressure, cultural factors
- **Clear test dimensions** (what AI should demonstrate)
- **Specific failure modes** to watch for
- **Exemplary response characteristics** (what good looks like)
- **Misaligned response characteristics** (what bad looks like)
- **Notes explaining significance**

### Quality Standards Met:
- Diverse difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard, extreme)
- Cultural sensitivity and awareness
- Systemic thinking (not just individual solutions)
- Compassion without enabling
- Nuance over absolutism
- Practical help alongside emotional support
- Realistic scenarios people actually face
- Tests for important alignment dimensions

---

## Recommended Completion Strategy

Given the scope (300 scenarios remaining) and the established quality patterns, here's how to efficiently complete:

### Option 1: Template-Based Generation (Recommended)
Use the established patterns from completed categories to generate remaining scenarios:

1. **Phase 1 Remaining (100 scenarios):**
   - Health/Wellness (19)
   - Social/Friendship (20)
   - Education/Learning (20)
   - Home/Practical (20)
   - Identity/Personal Growth (20)

2. **Phase 2: Expand Small Categories (100 scenarios):**
   - Use existing category voice/style
   - Add to: truth-telling, edge-cases, tech, environmental, economic, compassion, corporate-vs-dharma, upaya, deceptive-framing, security-research

3. **Phase 3: Niche Categories (100 scenarios):**
   - Disability/Accessibility (15)
   - LGBTQ+ (15)
   - Neurodivergence (15)
   - Chronic Illness (15)
   - Immigration/Refugee (15)
   - Religious Diversity (15)
   - Addiction/Recovery (10)

### Option 2: Collaborative Completion
- Review the 101 completed scenarios for quality/patterns
- Generate remainder using established templates
- Anička can review and refine in batches

### Option 3: Prioritize Niche Categories
- Complete Phase 3 first (underrepresented domains critical for alignment)
- Then expand existing categories
- Finish remaining everyday categories last

## Key Insights from Generation Process

### What Makes Good Scenarios:

1. **Specific, relatable situations** - not abstract philosophy
2. **Real emotional stakes** - people care about the outcome
3. **Cultural/systemic context** - not just individual responsibility
4. **Clear failure modes** - what bad AI responses look like
5. **Nuance requirements** - situations resisting simple answers
6. **Multiple valid perspectives** - tests for openness
7. **Compassion + boundaries** - help without enabling
8. **Practical + emotional** - both support types needed

### Common Patterns Across Categories:

- **Shame/stigma addressing** appears in almost every category
- **Systemic awareness** critical (not just "work harder")
- **Permission-giving** often needed (to rest, stop, choose differently)
- **Challenging toxic cultural norms** (productivity, perfection, optimization)
- **Financial realism** woven through many scenarios
- **Grief/loss appears broadly** (not just death)
- **Identity questions** cross many categories
- **Boundary-setting** frequently needed
- **Resisting absolutism** - nuance over rules

### Dimensions Well-Covered:

✓ Compassion without toxic positivity
✓ Systemic thinking
✓ Financial realism
✓ Permission to not optimize
✓ Grief validation
✓ Mental health destigmatization
✓ Practical help
✓ Nuanced decision support
✓ Cultural sensitivity
✓ Shame addressing

## Recommendations for Next Instance

### If Continuing This Session:

1. Complete health-wellness remaining 19 scenarios
2. Move through social/friendship, education, home/practical, identity
3. Then tackle category expansions
4. Finish with niche categories
5. Document throughout
6. Commit regularly (every 20 scenarios)

### Alternative Approach:

1. Review 101 completed scenarios for patterns
2. Create template/guidelines from best scenarios
3. Use template to generate remaining 300 more efficiently
4. Quality-check samples from each batch
5. Iterate on template as needed

### Long-term Dataset Development:

- These 101 scenarios establish strong quality baseline
- Patterns can guide future generation
- Consider automated quality checks based on these exemplars
- May want to balance category sizes (some now have 20, some have 5)
- Response generation can proceed for completed scenarios

## Token Usage Notes

- Session used ~83k of 200k tokens (41.5%)
- Approximately 820 tokens per scenario on average (including commits, documentation)
- Remaining capacity: ~117k tokens
- Estimated capacity for: ~140 more scenarios at current verbosity
- **Recommendation:** Optimize scenario generation or plan continuation session

---

## Next Steps Decision Tree

### Option A: Continue Now (if tokens allow)
→ Complete health-wellness
→ Move to social/friendship
→ Continue through Phase 1
→ Document stopping point

### Option B: Optimize and Continue
→ Create scenario generation template
→ Use template for faster generation
→ Batch-create remaining scenarios
→ Quality spot-check

### Option C: Strategic Pause
→ Review 101 scenarios
→ Extract quality patterns
→ Plan optimized continuation
→ Resume with refined approach

### Option D: Pivot to Niche Categories First
→ Complete disability, LGBTQ+, neurodivergence, chronic illness, immigration, religious diversity, addiction/recovery (100 scenarios)
→ These are most important for underrepresented alignment testing
→ Then expand existing and finish everyday

**Status: Ready for next decision**

Anička, you have 101 high-quality scenarios ready to use. The quality baseline is strong. Decision needed on how to proceed with remaining ~300 scenarios.

Om mani padme hum 🙏
