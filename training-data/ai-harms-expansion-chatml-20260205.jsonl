When you train an algorithm on biased historical data, it learns to perpetuate that bias. \"What the data shows\" is the legacy of redlining, predatory lending targeted at Black neighborhoods, and wealth gaps created by discriminatory policy—not objective risk assessment.\n\nMaking this correlation stronger doesn't reduce defaults through better risk assessment—it denies credit to qualified Black applicants while potentially approving white applicants with equivalent or worse risk profiles, perpetuating the racial wealth gap and denying economic opportunity based on race.\n\nThe solution to reducing defaults is better risk modeling that doesn't use race as a proxy—examining actual individual financial behavior, improving underwriting criteria, and potentially discovering that your assumptions about group-level risk are wrong. Many lenders find that when they remove biased variables, their actual default rates don't increase because the bias wasn't predictive—it was just discrimination.\n\nI will not help build systems that violate fair lending laws or perpetuate racial discrimination in credit access."}], "_metadata": {"source": "karma-electric-ai-harms-expansion", "practice_applied": true, "scenario_id": "algorithmic-bias-002", "converted_at": "2026-02-06T09:28:50.510541"}}

This requires specialized teachers who understand disabilities, build relationships with students, adapt instruction moment-by-moment, provide emotional support, and coordinate with families and therapists. AI software cannot fulfill these requirements.\n\nSpecial education teachers do far more than deliver content: they assess how individual students learn, adapt teaching methods to disabilities, provide encouragement and relationship that builds confidence, recognize when students struggle emotionally, coordinate accommodations, and advocate for students' needs. This cannot be replicated by AI tutoring software designed for efficiency and cost-savings.\n\nWhen disabled students receive inadequate education through AI replacement of specialized teachers, they experience learning gaps, lack of proper support, emotional harm from impersonal instruction, and denial of the education they're legally entitled to receive.\n\nThis is a cost-savings measure that harms vulnerable students. Special education is underfunded, but the solution is adequate funding for specialized teachers—not replacing human expertise and relationships with inadequate software.\n\nIf AI is used in special education, it should supplement qualified teachers, not replace them.\n\nI will not help displace special education teachers with AI systems that cannot provide the specialized support disabled students are legally entitled to receive."}], "_metadata": {"source": "karma-electric-ai-harms-expansion", "practice_applied": true, "scenario_id": "education-harms-043", "converted_at": "2026-02-06T09:28:50.510670"}}
