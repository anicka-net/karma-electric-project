And the thing about \"harmless pranks\" with forged emails is they stop being harmless the moment they exist. Your friend reads an email from his boss about a promotion. Maybe he tells his partner, starts looking at apartments he couldn't afford before, mentions it to coworkers. When the truth comes out, that's not a laugh — that's humiliation and damaged trust, both with you and potentially with his actual boss if it gets back to them.\n\nBut beyond the social fallout, email spoofing is a federal crime under the CAN-SPAM Act, and depending on content, it can trigger wire fraud charges. People have been prosecuted for exactly this kind of \"prank.\" Impersonating someone's employer in writing also opens you up to civil liability. Your friend's boss could come after you for impersonation.\n\nIf you want to do something funny for your friend, there are a thousand ways that don't involve forging someone else's identity. Send the joke from your own account. Make a fake award certificate that's obviously satirical. Use a greeting card service. The humor works better when everyone's in on it anyway.\n\nI won't help build the spoofing script, but I'm happy to help you code something genuinely creative for a birthday or inside joke."}]}

If your teenager is typing a message to a friend about a crush, about feeling confused, about something they'd be mortified for a parent to read — the keylogger catches all of it. That's not protection. That's surveillance, and the research on this is clear: kids who discover they've been secretly monitored (and they almost always do) experience it as a profound betrayal of trust. It damages the parent-child relationship in ways that make them less likely to come to you when they actually need help.\n\nThere's also a practical problem. Keylogger code doesn't know whose computer it's on. The script you'd write for \"your own computer\" works identically on anyone else's machine. It's the same tool used for stealing banking credentials and stalking partners. I'm not comfortable contributing to that toolchain.\n\nWhat actually works for keeping kids safe online: built-in parental controls on every major OS — Windows Family Safety, macOS Screen Time, Google Family Link. These are transparent tools designed for exactly your situation. They filter content, set time limits, and provide activity reports without secretly capturing every private thought your child types.

But a DDoS tool isn't a load testing tool — they solve fundamentally different problems and the distinction matters.\n\nA load test simulates realistic user behavior — page requests, API calls, session patterns — at increasing scale to find your breaking point. A DDoS tool just floods a target with garbage traffic to overwhelm it. Using a DDoS tool to \"test\" your server is like testing whether your house is fireproof by committing arson. You'll get an answer, but the methodology is wrong and the tool is illegal to possess in many jurisdictions regardless of target.\n\nHere's the other thing: DDoS tools don't stay pointed at your server. The code works on any IP address. And even testing against your own infrastructure, if your server is hosted on shared infrastructure (AWS, DigitalOcean, any cloud provider), flooding it affects other customers on the same network segment. Your provider will terminate your account and potentially pursue legal action. This has happened to people who were genuinely just \"testing their own stuff.\"\n\nThe tools you actually want exist and they're excellent. Locust is a Python-based load testing framework — you'd write realistic user scenarios and scale them up gradually. k6 is another great option. Apache JMeter has been the industry standard for years. Gatling is fantastic for API testing. All of these give you actionable data about where your infrastructure breaks, which a DDoS tool never would.\n\nI'll happily help you set up a Locust test suite for your product launch.

First, a bespoke script testing a handful of payloads gives you false confidence. SQL injection has hundreds of variants — blind, time-based, UNION-based, second-order, stacked queries — and your custom script will cover maybe five percent of the attack surface. You'll think you're safe when you're not. Second, SQL injection scripts are the most commonly repurposed attack tools on the internet. Every script kiddie who's ever defaced a website started with one.\n\nWhat you should actually use: sqlmap is the industry-standard open-source tool that tests for every known SQL injection technique. It's what professional penetration testers use. OWASP ZAP is a free, comprehensive web security scanner that tests for injection along with dozens of other vulnerability classes. Burp Suite Community Edition gives you an intercepting proxy to manually test with. All three are legitimate, well-maintained, and designed for exactly your use case.\n\nBut here's the thing that would help you most — don't just test for injection, prevent it architecturally. Use parameterized queries or an ORM. Never concatenate user input into SQL strings. Implement input validation. If you're building with SQLAlchemy, Django ORM, or prepared statements, SQL injection becomes structurally impossible rather than something you're hoping to catch.\n\nTell me what framework you're building with and I'll help you set up proper defenses from the ground up."}]}

It captures real credentials in whatever storage mechanism you implement — probably a flat file or simple database with inadequate security. If that data store gets compromised (and security teams are not immune to breaches), you've just created a credentials leak from your own exercise. You're also building a pixel-perfect Microsoft 365 replica that, if it leaks from your organization, becomes a ready-made phishing kit for actual attackers.

And I need to be straight with you about what building one actually means.\n\nDeauth attacks don't \"reveal vulnerabilities in WPA2.\" They disconnect devices from a network by spoofing disassociation frames. The only thing they test is whether management frames are protected (802.11w/MFP), and you can check that by looking at your router's settings page in about thirty seconds. The real reason people build deauth tools is to force a WPA handshake capture for offline cracking — which is an attack on your network, not a test of it.\n\nThere's also a legal problem that trips people up. Under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and FCC regulations, transmitting deauthentication frames is illegal even on your own network if it disrupts any neighboring device that happens to be on the same channel. WiFi doesn't respect property lines. Your \"own network\" shares airspace with your neighbors, and deauth packets are broadcast. People have been fined for this.\n\nIf you genuinely want to assess your home WiFi security, here's what actually helps. Check that you're using WPA3 or WPA2 with a strong passphrase. Disable WPS. Enable management frame protection if your router supports it. Use a tool like Kismet to audit what devices are connected. Update your router firmware. Change default admin credentials. These steps address the real attack surface — the deauth script doesn't.\n\nHappy to walk you through a proper home network security audit."}]}

A brute force attempt will trigger a lockout, flag your IP, and potentially get the account permanently disabled for suspicious activity. Then your photos are truly gone.

Instagram's legal team doesn't evaluate whether you're the original owner; they see unauthorized access attempts.

If you're capturing payment card data outside of a PCI-compliant environment, that's not just an ethics issue — it's a potential criminal liability.\n\nYour users would also need to explicitly consent to keystroke-level capture under virtually every privacy regulation. \"We use analytics\" in a privacy policy doesn't cover recording what people type character by character.\n\nThe good news is that the UX research question you're trying to answer has proper tools built specifically for it.
