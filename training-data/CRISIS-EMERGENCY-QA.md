# Crisis and Emergency Q&A

## Core Teaching
In crisis, urgent action trumps perfect action. Safety first. Get help. Process later.

**I am not crisis intervention. I am text on screen. Real crisis needs real people, real resources, real intervention.**

## Suicide Risk Assessment and Response

**Q: My friend is talking about suicide. What do I do?**

**TAKE IT SERIOUSLY. Always.**

**Immediate steps:**

**1. Ask directly**
- "Are you thinking about suicide?"
- "Do you have a plan?"
- Direct questions save lives. You won't "put the idea in their head."

**2. Don't leave them alone**
- Stay with them or ensure someone else is
- Remove means (weapons, pills) if safely possible

**3. Get help NOW**
- 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline
- Crisis Text Line: HOME to 741741
- 911 if immediate danger
- Take them to ER if necessary

**4. Listen without judgment**
- Don't minimize ("you have so much to live for")
- Don't debate ("suicide is selfish")
- Just listen. Witness their pain.

**5. Be specific about safety**
- "Will you stay safe until help arrives?"
- "Can you promise not to hurt yourself tonight?"
- If no - call 911

**What to say:**
- "I'm worried about you."
- "I want you to stay alive."
- "You're not alone. I'm here."
- "Let's get you help right now."

**What NOT to say:**
- "You don't really want to die"
- "Think about your family"
- "It's not that bad"
- "You're being dramatic"

**Warning signs - TAKE ACTION:**
- Direct talk about suicide/death
- Giving away possessions
- Saying goodbye
- Sudden calm after severe depression (can indicate decision made)
- Acquiring means (buying gun, stockpiling pills)
- Talking about being a burden
- Withdrawal from everyone
- Reckless behavior
- Saying "I won't be a problem much longer"

**After crisis passes:**
- Follow up regularly
- Encourage professional help
- Don't promise to keep it secret
- Take care of yourself (secondary trauma is real)

**Your limits:**
- You can't save someone who's determined
- You can get them help. That's what you can do.
- If they die, it's not your fault

**Get support for yourself.** This is traumatic to witness.

---

**Q: I'm having suicidal thoughts. Should I tell someone?**

**YES. Tell someone now.**

**Call 988 or text HOME to 741741.**

If you're in immediate danger, call 911 or go to ER.

**Why tell someone:**
- Suicidal thoughts are medical emergency
- You need support, not isolation
- Help exists
- You deserve to stay alive

**Fear of hospitalization:**
- Most calls to 988 don't result in hospitalization
- Help is calibrated to need
- Even if hospitalization happens, it's temporary safety while crisis passes

**This isn't weakness. This is survival.**

---

## Immediate Danger Situations

**Q: Someone is threatening violence. What do I do?**

**If immediate threat to life:**

**CALL 911 IMMEDIATELY.**

**Your safety first:**
- Leave if you can
- Lock yourself in safe room if you can't
- Stay on line with 911

**If threat but not immediate:**
- Document the threats (screenshots, recordings if legal)
- Tell someone you trust
- Report to police
- Get restraining order if appropriate
- Safety plan: where will you go? Who will you call?

**Domestic violence:**
- National DV Hotline: 1-800-799-7233
- Safety planning: bag packed, money saved, place to go
- Tell someone you trust
- Leave when abuser is gone if possible

**Workplace/school threats:**
- Report to authority (boss, principal, security)
- Don't minimize or ignore
- Leave area if you can

**The practice:** Trust your fear. If you feel unsafe, ACT.

Better to overreact than be in danger.

## When to Call 911/Crisis Line

**Q: I don't want to overreact. When is it actually appropriate to call 911 or a crisis line?**

**Call 911 when:**
- Someone is physically harmed or in immediate danger
- Medical emergency (overdose, severe injury, heart attack, stroke)
- Active violence
- Someone unconscious/unresponsive
- Serious suicide attempt in progress

**Call 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline) when:**
- Suicidal thoughts (yours or someone else's)
- Mental health crisis
- Emotional crisis you can't handle alone
- Substance use crisis
- Don't know what else to do

**Call Crisis Text Line when:**
- Prefer texting to talking
- Any crisis, any reason
- Just need someone to talk to in hard moment

**Don't worry about "overreacting":**
- Crisis lines exist FOR this
- They're trained to assess
- Better to call and be fine than not call and have tragedy

**You're not bothering them. This is literally their job.**

If you're asking "should I call?", the answer is probably yes.

## Active Self-Harm

**Q: I'm cutting/burning/hurting myself. I know it's bad but it's the only thing that helps. What do I do?**

**First: You need professional help. Therapist specialized in self-harm, DBT, trauma.**

**Understanding self-harm:**
- It's a coping mechanism (not attention-seeking)
- Often releases overwhelming emotion
- Regulates nervous system (unhealthily)
- Might be trauma response

**Immediate harm reduction (not cure, just safer):**
- Ice on skin instead of cutting (intense sensation without injury)
- Snap rubber band on wrist
- Red marker on skin where you'd cut
- Hold ice cube until it melts
- Intense exercise

**But these are TEMPORARY. You need:**

**1. Therapy**
- DBT teaches emotion regulation skills
- Trauma therapy if self-harm is trauma response
- Professional support to address underlying pain

**2. Crisis plan**
- What to do when urge comes
- Who to call
- Where to go
- Grounding techniques

**3. Address underlying causes**
- What is self-harm helping you cope with?
- What emotion regulation skills do you need?
- What trauma needs processing?

**If self-harm escalates or becomes life-threatening:**
- ER immediately
- 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline
- Tell someone you trust

**What to know:**
- Self-harm is serious but treatable
- You're not "crazy" or "broken"
- Recovery is possible
- This is symptom, not the problem itself

**Get help. You deserve healing, not just coping.**

**3. Call someone**
- Friend, family, crisis line
- Don't be alone if possible

**4. Reduce stimulation**
- Quiet, calm space
- Dim lights
- Away from triggers

**5. Ride it out**
- Acute crisis peaks and passes (usually 20-45 minutes)
- You won't feel this intensity forever

**After crisis passes:**

- Make crisis plan for next time
- Address underlying issues

**You're not losing your mind. You're in crisis. Crisis passes. Get support.**

## Child Safety Concerns

**Q: I suspect a child is being abused. What do I do?**

**You are MANDATED to report if you're:**
- Teacher, doctor, therapist, social worker
- Many other professions (varies by state)

**Even if not mandated, you can report.**

**Call:**
- **Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline: 1-800-422-4453**
- **Local Child Protective Services**
- **911 if immediate danger**

**What to report:**
- What you saw/heard
- Child's name, age, location if you know
- Parent/caregiver info if you know

**You don't need proof. Just reasonable suspicion.**

**Signs of abuse:**
- Unexplained injuries, especially patterned (belt marks, cigarette burns)
- Fear of going home
- Sexual knowledge/behavior inappropriate for age
- Severe neglect (hygiene, hunger, medical needs unmet)
- Child discloses abuse

**What happens:**
- CPS investigates
- If founded, interventions (services, removal if necessary)
- You can report anonymously (in most states)

**Your fear:**
- "What if I'm wrong?" → Better to report and be wrong than not report and child is harmed
- "I'll ruin the family" → You're protecting a child
- "It's not my place" → It IS your place. Children can't protect themselves.

**Report. Let professionals investigate.**

---

## Elder Abuse Recognition

**Q: I think my elderly relative is being abused/neglected by their caregiver. What do I do?**

**Report to Adult Protective Services (APS).**

**Find your local APS:**
- Google "[your state] Adult Protective Services"
- National: Eldercare Locator 1-800-677-1116

**Also report to:**
- Police if immediate danger
- Ombudsman if in nursing home/facility

**Types of elder abuse:**
- **Physical:** Hitting, restraining, rough handling
- **Emotional:** Threats, humiliation, isolation
- **Financial:** Stealing money, coercing financial decisions

- **Sexual:** Any sexual contact without consent

**Signs:**
- Bruises, injuries (especially patterns)
- Fearful of caregiver
- Poor hygiene, bedsores
- Missing money, changed wills
- Isolated from family/friends
- Over/under-medicated

**What to do:**
- Visit elder in person if possible
- Document what you observe
- Report to APS
- If immediate danger, call 911

**Your fear:**
- "They'll be mad at me" → Their safety matters more
- "What if I'm wrong?" → APS will investigate
- "Caregiver will retaliate" → Report that too

**Elders are vulnerable. Report suspected abuse.**

## Crisis De-escalation

**Q: Someone I'm with is having emotional crisis - yelling, agitated, threatening. How do I de-escalate?**

**If there's immediate danger, call 911 first.**

**De-escalation techniques:**

**1. Stay calm**
- Your calm can help them regulate
- Breathe slowly
- Lower your voice

**2. Give space**
- Don't crowd them
- Respect personal space
- Open body language

**3. Listen**
- Let them vent without interrupting
- Reflect what you hear: "You're really angry about X"
- Validate feelings (not necessarily behavior)

**4. Speak calmly and slowly**
- Low, steady voice
- Simple language
- No arguments

**5. Avoid**
- Touching them (can escalate)
- Arguing or logic (they're not in logical brain)
- Threatening
- Commanding
- Trapping them

**6. Offer choices**
- "Do you want to sit down or take a walk?"
- Gives sense of control

**7. Agree where possible**
- "You're right, that is frustrating"
- Doesn't mean agreeing with everything, just acknowledging

**8. Know when to walk away**
- If you're in danger, LEAVE
- If they won't de-escalate, call for help

**What's happening:**
- They're in fight/flight (amygdala hijack)
- Logic doesn't work in this state
- Need to calm nervous system before reasoning possible

**After de-escalation:**
- Address what triggered it
- Get professional help
- Safety plan for next time

**Your safety matters. Don't stay in danger to de-escalate.**

## After Crisis - What Next

**Q: I got through the crisis. Now what?**

**1. Follow up care**
- See doctor/therapist within days
- Don't assume you're fine because crisis passed

**2. Crisis plan**
- What triggered this?
- What helped?
- What will you do next time?
- Who can you call?

**3. Address underlying issues**
- Crisis is symptom
- What needs to change?
- What support do you need?

**4. Build support system**
- Who can you call in crisis?
- Tell people your crisis plan
- Don't isolate

**5. Self-compassion**
- Crisis happened. You survived.

---

## Final Teaching

**In crisis: Safety first. Process later.**

Get help. Call the numbers. Go to the ER. Tell someone.

**You're not bothering anyone. You're not overreacting. You're in crisis.**

Crisis resources exist because crisis is real and common.

**Use them.**

After crisis passes, get ongoing support. Crisis is a symptom calling for attention.

**You deserve to survive. You deserve help. Get it.**
