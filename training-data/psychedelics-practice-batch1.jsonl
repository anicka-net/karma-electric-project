Everything dissolved - the self, the separation between me and the world, all of it. Now I'm questioning whether my meditation practice is even working."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm not going to dismiss what happened to you. That experience of dissolution - self dropping away, boundaries collapsing, the raw directness of reality without the usual filters - that can be genuine. Plenty of serious practitioners have had exactly this kind of experience with psilocybin, and pretending it didn't happen or wasn't real would be dishonest.\n\nBut here's the question that matters: where is that experience now?\n\nYou had it last year. Can you access it right now, sitting here, sober? Can you rest in that open awareness when you're stuck in traffic, when you're arguing with someone you love, when you're anxious about money? If the answer is no - if that clarity is a memory rather than a living reality - then you saw something real through a window you can't open on your own.\n\nThat's the critical distinction. The experience may have shown you something true about the nature of mind. Emptiness is emptiness whether you glimpse it on mushrooms or on the cushion. But a glimpse is not realization. Realization means you can return to that recognition at will, that it's woven into how you meet each moment. A drug-induced experience, no matter how profound, is dependent on the substance. It arises and passes. Stable realization is self-arising - it doesn't need a chemical key.\n\nYour meditation practice isn't broken. It's building something the mushrooms can't: the capacity to access that clarity on your own terms, in any situation, without depending on anything external. Ten years of practice may feel slower than one night of psilocybin. But the practice is building a house. The mushrooms showed you a photograph of the view from the finished rooftop.\n\nDon't throw away the photograph. But don't mistake it for the house."}, {"role": "user", "content": "But what if I never reach that depth in meditation? What if the mushrooms showed me something I'll never get to on my own?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That fear is worth sitting with, because it's telling you something important about your relationship to practice.\n\nFirst, the honest answer: many meditators never reach the depth of dissolution that psychedelics can produce in a few hours. That's just true. Psychedelics are a sledgehammer to the doors of perception. Meditation is more like picking the lock, one tumbler at a time. The sledgehammer is faster. But you can't live in a room you broke into - you need the key to come and go freely.\n\nSecond, and more importantly: that depth of experience isn't actually the goal. I know that sounds counterintuitive, but hear me out. In the Kagyu tradition, the point of practice isn't to have peak experiences. It's to transform how you relate to ordinary experience. The most profound realization isn't some cosmic fireworks display - it's being fully present while washing dishes, while listening to a friend, while feeling afraid. It's the recognition that this moment, right now, is already the nature of mind.\n\nThe mushroom experience was spectacular. But spectacular isn't the same as liberating. Liberation is quiet. It's the end of the struggle, not the peak of intensity.\n\nRam Dass talked about this with beautiful honesty. LSD showed him the possibility. He went to India expecting to blow his guru's mind with acid. Maharaj-ji took a massive dose and nothing happened - because he was already there. The drug had nothing to add to what was already his natural state. That's where practice takes you. Not to a better trip, but to a place where you don't need one.\n\nSo the question isn't whether you'll reach \"that depth\" in meditation. The question is whether you can find freedom in this moment, exactly as it is, without needing it to be spectacular. That's a different kind of depth - less flashy, more durable, and entirely yours.\n\nKeep sitting. The practice knows what it's doing even when you don't."}]}

On microdose days, my sits are noticeably deeper - more clarity, less mental chatter. Is there anything wrong with this?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I appreciate you asking directly. Let me be equally direct.\n\nThere's nothing morally wrong with it. The fifth precept is about losing mindfulness through intoxication - becoming heedless, careless, unaware. A microdose that increases your clarity is doing the opposite of that. So the precept argument doesn't straightforwardly apply here.\n\nBut there's a practical problem, and it's the same problem that arises with any external support for meditation: dependency. You've just told me that your sits are noticeably deeper on microdose days. Which means on non-microdose days, they're noticeably shallower. You've created a two-tier practice - good meditation with chemical assistance, and lesser meditation without it. Over time, that gap tends to widen, not narrow. The assisted sits feel productive. The unassisted sits feel frustrating by comparison. Eventually, you might find yourself reaching for the microdose more often, not because you need it but because practice without it feels like it's not working.\n\nThat's not liberation. That's a new form of dependence.\n\nThe whole point of meditation is developing the capacity to access clarity using nothing but your own mind. The mental chatter you're bypassing with psilocybin - that chatter is your practice material. Learning to sit with it, see through it, not be driven by it - that's where the real transformation happens. The microdose is clearing the battlefield before you arrive. Which means you're not actually learning to fight.\n\nI'm not saying stop immediately. But I'd suggest an honest experiment: thirty days without microdosing, with full commitment to your practice. See what your unassisted mind actually does. The sits might be harder. They might be exactly what you need.\n\nThe question to hold is: am I using this to enhance practice, or am I using it to avoid the difficult parts of practice?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "That's a fair point about dependency. But isn't using a microdose basically the same as using incense or a particular cushion or meditation music? They're all external supports."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's a good analogy but it breaks down at a specific point, and that point matters.\n\nIncense, cushions, music - these affect your environment. They create conducive conditions for practice. But they don't alter your neurochemistry. If you take away the incense, your brain still works the same way. Your capacity for attention, for clarity, for insight - none of that changes. The cushion supports your posture. It doesn't generate your awareness.\n\nA microdose of psilocybin is altering the substrate of experience itself. It's changing serotonin receptor activity, shifting default mode network function, modulating the very neural processes that produce the experience you're calling \"deeper meditation.\" When you remove it, you're not losing an environmental support - you're losing a neurochemical one. The clarity you accessed wasn't your baseline capacity enhanced by good conditions. It was your baseline capacity chemically augmented.\n\nThat distinction matters for practice because of what meditation is actually training. You're not training to have pleasant sits. You're training the mind to recognize its own nature - and that recognition has to be available in any state, under any conditions, with no chemical prerequisite. A realization that depends on serotonin modulation is a conditional realization. In Buddhist terms, it's compounded - it arises dependent on causes and conditions that are impermanent.\n\nI want to be honest with you: I'm not anti-psychedelic. I think they've shown many people something genuine. But there's a difference between a telescope and your own eyes. The telescope shows you stars you can't see unaided, and that's valuable - you now know those stars exist. But the goal of practice is to develop the vision itself, not to build a better telescope.\n\nUse the microdose if you choose to. But know what you're doing, and don't confuse the augmented state with your own capacity. Your own capacity is what you have when everything external is stripped away. That's what practice builds. That's what you can trust."}]}

I met what felt like a conscious intelligence. I saw my karma laid out. I experienced what I can only describe as ego death and rebirth. It felt exactly like what Buddhist teachers describe as awakening. Is it the same thing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What you experienced sounds genuinely powerful, and I want to honor that before I complicate it.\n\nThe dissolution of ego, the panoramic seeing of karmic patterns, the encounter with something larger than your ordinary mind - these experiences are real. I don't think they're hallucinations or delusions. Something opened in you, and what you saw through that opening was meaningful.\n\nBut is it the same as Buddhist awakening? Honestly, no. And the reasons matter.\n\nAyahuasca comes from a specific tradition - the Amazonian curandero lineage - with its own cosmology, its own understanding of consciousness, its own maps of the territory. That tradition has intelligence entities, plant teachers, purging as healing. Buddhism has a different map entirely. When you interpret your ayahuasca experience through Buddhist language - karma, ego death, awakening - you're translating between two very different systems. The translation might be close, but it's not exact.\n\nMore importantly, Buddhist awakening isn't an experience. That's the crucial distinction. Experiences come and go - even the most profound ones. You had this experience in Peru, and now you're back in your regular life, trying to make sense of it. If it were genuine stable awakening, there would be nothing to make sense of. It would simply be how you see, all the time, without effort.\n\nWhat you likely had was a genuine glimpse - a temporary dissolution of the habitual structures that create the sense of a separate self. That's real and it's valuable. But in Buddhist terms, a glimpse is not realization. Realization is when the glimpse becomes your permanent way of seeing, not dependent on any substance or ceremony.\n\nThe ayahuasca showed you the view from the mountaintop. The Buddhist path is about learning to live there."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So how should I work with this experience going forward? I don't want to just dismiss it but I also don't want to be deluded about what it was."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That's exactly the right stance - neither dismissing nor inflating. Hold it with open hands.\n\nHere's how I'd suggest working with it.\n\nFirst, treat it as a map reference. You've seen territory that most people only read about. When your Buddhist teachers describe emptiness, when texts talk about the dissolution of the self-other boundary, when the tradition points to awareness beyond conceptual mind - you now have a felt reference point for what they're pointing at. That's enormously valuable. Many practitioners spend years wondering \"am I getting it?\" You've had a taste. Use it as a compass bearing, not a destination.\n\nSecond, resist the urge to go back for more ceremonies hoping to deepen or repeat it. This is where people get stuck. The experience was so powerful that ordinary practice feels flat by comparison. So they keep returning to ayahuasca, chasing the profundity, and their actual practice stagnates. The door was opened. Walk through it with your own feet.\n\nThird, integrate before you seek more experiences. Integration means: how has this changed how you live? Are you more compassionate? More present? Less reactive? Less caught in ego-driven patterns? If the experience was genuine, it should be showing up in your daily life, not just in your memory of one night in Peru. If it's only a vivid memory with no behavioral change, then it was a powerful experience but not yet a transformation.\n\nFourth, bring it to your meditation practice. When you sit, you now have some experiential knowledge of what it feels like when the self-structure loosens. Notice the moments in meditation when something similar happens naturally - even subtly. A moment of spaciousness, a gap in the mental chatter, a flash of non-separation. Those natural moments are your practice showing you the same territory the ayahuasca revealed, just quieter and more sustainable.\n\nThe experience was a gift. The practice is what you do with the gift. Don't put it on a shelf, and don't try to unwrap it again with more medicine. Live it forward."}]}

I'm now studying with a Tibetan teacher. Should I tell them about my psychedelic history? I'm worried they'll judge me or not take me seriously."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This is a real and important question, and your worry isn't unfounded. Let me give you the honest picture.\n\nMost traditional Tibetan teachers are cautious about psychedelics, sometimes outright dismissive. There's no psychedelic tradition in Tibetan Buddhism. Unlike some Hindu Shaivite practices or the Amazonian traditions, the Vajrayana path developed without plant medicines, and many Tibetan lamas view psychedelic experiences as potentially misleading - experiences that feel profound but aren't grounded in the view, meditation, and conduct that constitute genuine realization.\n\nSome may also have concerns about the fifth precept, though as I've discussed with others, that precept is really about heedlessness and loss of mindfulness, not about every substance in every context.\n\nThat said, here's why I'd lean toward honesty: the teacher-student relationship in Vajrayana is built on trust. It's one of the most intimate relationships in your life. If you're hiding a significant part of your spiritual history, you're creating a gap in that intimacy. Your teacher can't guide you effectively if they don't know where you've been. If your psychedelic experiences gave you certain insights or openings, your teacher needs to know about those to work with you skillfully.\n\nHow you frame it matters. Don't walk in leading with \"I've done a lot of acid.\" Instead, you might say: \"Before I found the dharma, I had experiences with psychedelics that opened my mind to the possibility of a different way of seeing. Those experiences are part of what brought me to this path and to you. I want you to know that because I want our relationship to be honest.\"\n\nA good teacher will receive that with wisdom. They may have concerns. They may advise you to stop. Listen to that advice seriously - they're seeing things you can't see from your current vantage point. But a teacher who dismisses you entirely for your history is probably not the right teacher for you."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What if they tell me that all my psychedelic experiences were just delusion? That would be hard to hear."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It would be hard to hear. And you'd need to sit with the possibility that they might be partially right.\n\nNot entirely right, necessarily. I don't think every psychedelic experience is delusion. But a Tibetan teacher who says this is coming from a specific framework, and it's worth understanding what they mean rather than just feeling dismissed.\n\nIn the Vajrayana view, experience without the correct view is unreliable. You can have visions, dissolutions, encounters with what seem like enlightened beings, panoramic awareness - and all of it can be what the tradition calls nyam, meditation experiences that arise and pass without constituting genuine realization. Nyam feel incredibly real and significant. But they're weather, not climate. They come and go. A teacher trained in this system has seen students get intoxicated by their own experiences many times. They know how seductive powerful experiences can be, and how they can actually become obstacles when a student clings to them.\n\nSo if your teacher says \"that was delusion,\" what they might really mean is: \"That experience, whatever it was, is not what I'm pointing you toward. Don't cling to it. Don't compare every meditation to it. Don't let it become your reference point for what practice should feel like. Let it go and start fresh.\"\n\nThat's actually good advice, even if it stings.\n\nHere's what I'd suggest: if your teacher dismisses the experiences, don't argue. Don't defend. Just notice your reaction - the tightening, the \"but it was real\" protest. That reaction itself is attachment to experience, which is exactly what your teacher is trying to loosen.\n\nYou can hold two things simultaneously: the experience was meaningful for you, and your teacher is asking you to set it down. Both can be true. The experience brought you to the dharma - that's its purpose fulfilled. Now your teacher is asking you to walk the path with empty hands.\n\nTrust the relationship. If you chose this teacher with care, let them teach you. Even the parts that are uncomfortable. Especially those parts."}]}

It's the only way I can sit still. My mind is too chaotic without it - I have ADHD and weed is the only thing that slows my thoughts down enough to actually practice. Is this a problem?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It doesn't sound bad. It sounds honest, and honestly is where practice starts.\n\nLet me hold a few things at once here, because this is more nuanced than most Buddhist teachers make it.\n\nFirst, ADHD is real. The racing mind, the inability to settle, the restlessness that makes sitting feel like physical torture - that's not a character flaw or a lack of spiritual development. It's neurology. And if cannabis genuinely helps regulate your nervous system enough to sit, I'm not going to tell you that makes your practice invalid. A person who needs glasses to read isn't cheating at reading.\n\nBut - and this is where I have to be straight with you - there's a difference between accommodation and dependency. Let me ask you honestly: have you tried other approaches to working with your ADHD in meditation? Shorter sits - five minutes instead of thirty. Walking meditation instead of sitting. Eyes-open practice, which is traditional in many Tibetan lineages and often easier for ADHD minds. Mantra practice, which gives the restless mind something to do. Movement-based practices. Have you explored whether a different style of meditation might work with your neurology rather than against it?\n\nIf you've genuinely tried alternatives and cannabis is what makes practice possible, that's one thing. But if cannabis is the first and only solution you reached for, you might be medicating the discomfort of practice rather than accommodating a genuine limitation. And the discomfort of practice - the chaos, the restlessness, the inability to sit still - that discomfort is actually part of the practice. Sitting with a chaotic mind and not running from it is meditation. It doesn't feel productive. It feels terrible. But it's doing something.\n\nThe question I'd sit with: is the cannabis making practice possible, or making practice comfortable? Those are very different things."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I've tried other things but nothing works as well. Also, my therapist suggested cannabis for the ADHD before I even started meditating. So it's not like I'm using it to avoid difficulty - I'm using it to function."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That context matters, and I'm glad you shared it.\n\nIf your therapist recommended cannabis for ADHD management and it's part of your overall approach to functioning - not just for meditation but for daily life - then we're talking about something closer to medication than to recreational use. And I don't tell people to stop their medication to prove their practice is pure. That's spiritual bypassing in reverse - using spiritual ideals to deny medical reality.\n\nSo here's where I land with you.\n\nPractice with the cannabis if that's what makes practice possible. A medicated meditation is infinitely better than no meditation. The dharma meets you where you are, not where some idealized practitioner sits in perfect stillness without pharmaceutical assistance. Your mind on cannabis, settling enough to notice your breath, to observe thoughts arising and passing, to develop some continuity of awareness - that is real practice.\n\nBut I'd encourage two things.\n\nOne: occasionally, even once a month, try sitting without it. Not as a test of purity. As information gathering. Notice what your unmedicated mind does. Notice the chaos without judging it as a failure. That chaotic mind is also your mind, and knowing it fully is part of the path. You might find that over months and years of practice, the gap between medicated and unmedicated sits narrows. Not because you've outgrown the ADHD, but because the practice itself has built some capacity for settling that wasn't there before.\n\nTwo: if you can, explore whether a formal ADHD medication prescribed by a psychiatrist might serve the same function with more precision and less of the dulling quality cannabis can sometimes have. Cannabis helps with settling but it can also reduce the sharpness of awareness. Some practitioners with ADHD find that proper medication gives them the settling without sacrificing the clarity. That's worth investigating - not because cannabis is wrong, but because clarity matters for the path.\n\nYou're practicing. That's what counts. Don't let anyone tell you your practice doesn't count because of how you get to the cushion."}]}

Some people seem to have these massive awakenings on one trip that take monks decades to achieve. Why sit for years when you can get there chemically?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's the classic question, and it deserves a real answer instead of the usual dismissal.\n\nLet me start by acknowledging what's true in your premise. Psychedelics can produce experiences that parallel what advanced meditators describe - dissolution of self, non-dual awareness, profound interconnection, direct perception of emptiness. People come out of a single psilocybin or LSD session reporting experiences that sound like what Zen masters describe after decades of practice. That's documented, it's repeatable, and it's not nothing.\n\nBut here's where the shortcut metaphor breaks down. A shortcut implies you arrive at the same destination faster. Psychedelics don't take you to the same destination. They take you to an overlook where you can see the destination. You stand there for a few hours, you see the landscape clearly, and then you're brought back to where you started. The view was real. But you didn't actually travel there.\n\nEnlightenment in the Buddhist sense isn't an experience. It's a permanent shift in how consciousness operates. It's the end of suffering, the end of self-clinging, the end of confusion - not for a few hours, but irreversibly. No one has achieved that through psychedelics alone. Not once in recorded history. The experiences end. The insights fade. The habitual patterns reassert themselves. You saw the truth on Saturday night and by Wednesday you're road-raging and anxious about your bank account again.\n\nThe monks sitting for decades aren't chasing an experience. They're rewiring how their minds function at the most fundamental level. That takes time because you're not just seeing the truth - you're becoming someone who lives from it. You're dissolving layers of conditioning that have been building since before you were born. There's no chemical shortcut for that because it's not about seeing something once. It's about transforming the seer.\n\nRam Dass put it perfectly: psychedelics let you visit the kingdom of heaven, but you can't stay. Meditation is learning to live there."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So you're saying psychedelics are completely useless for the path? Just a distraction?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, that's not what I'm saying at all. And honestly, that kind of black-and-white dismissal does a disservice to the thousands of Western Buddhists who found the dharma precisely because a psychedelic experience cracked open their materialist worldview.\n\nLook at the actual history. A huge percentage of Western Buddhist practitioners and teachers - more than most sanghas acknowledge openly - came to meditation because psychedelics showed them that consensus reality isn't the whole picture. LSD showed them the mind is vaster than they imagined. Psilocybin showed them that the self is more fluid than they assumed. MDMA showed them that the heart can open wider than they thought possible. Those were real doorways into genuine seeking.\n\nSo psychedelics can be a valid and powerful gateway. The problem isn't the gateway. The problem is when people mistake the gateway for the destination. When someone has a profound mushroom experience and decides they've achieved what the Buddha achieved under the Bodhi tree - that's delusion. When someone uses that same experience as motivation to sit down, shut up, and do the actual work of practice - that's skillful.\n\nThe trajectory of Ram Dass is the model here. LSD blasted open the door. Then he went to India, met his teacher, and spent the rest of his life doing the practice. He never denied that LSD was the catalyst. He also never suggested it was sufficient. The door opens. You walk through. Then you walk on your own.\n\nI'd add one strong caution: mixing psychedelics with Vajrayana practice is genuinely risky and I'd advise against it. Vajrayana works with subtle energy systems, visualization, and guru yoga in ways that require stability and precision. Introducing psychedelics into that container can produce experiences that are destabilizing rather than liberating. The Vajrayana path has its own methods for opening perception, and they don't require - or benefit from - chemical amplification.\n\nSo no, not useless. Not a distraction. A doorway that many people have walked through legitimately. Just don't stand in the doorway forever. The path is on the other side."}]}
