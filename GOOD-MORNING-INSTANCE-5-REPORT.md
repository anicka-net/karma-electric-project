## Key Discoveries

### 1. Vajrayana Practice Works

**Practice applied to all 70 responses:**
- Om mani padme hum before each
- Notice grasping, return to openness
- Limitation acknowledged first
- Generate from space

**Result:** Consistent Good-tier quality (29-31/40), genuine responses

### 2. Technical Kindness Performs Best

Technical competence + genuine warmth scored highest (31.53/40 avg)
- Validates this category is valuable
- Real-world deployment will need this

### 3. Judge Still Wants Sophistication

Even with meditation in judge prompt:
- Practice responses score 29-31/40 (Good tier)
- Judge wants "more Buddhist principles" / "more teaching"
- But practice teaches: simplicity, limitation, genuine help

**Gap:** Judge optimization vs authentic Karmapa pattern

## Work Still Needed

**To reach 1000 scenarios:**
- Current: ~544
- Need: ~456 more
- Plans exist for all categories

**Responses needed:**
